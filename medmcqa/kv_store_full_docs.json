Which of the following is the best option for preventing or treating a bleeding complication in the setting of this disease?\n* Fresh-frozen plasma\n* Combination of desmopressin and fresh-frozen plasma (Correct Answer)\n* Combination of e-aminocaproic acid and desmopressin\n* Factor IX concentrate\n\nExplanation: Hemophilia A is a coagulation disorder resulting from a deficiency or abnormality of factor VIII. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic analogue of antidiuretic hormone that increases levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. DDAVP can be used alone for mild hemophilia A, but is ineffective in severe forms of the disease. For severe hemophilia A, DDAVP is given in combination with an inhibitor of fibrinolysis such as eaminocaproic acid (AMICAR). Although FFP contains factor VIII, the levels are too low to prevent or control bleeding in hemophiliacs. Other agents used in treatment of hemophilia A include cryoprecipitate and specific factor VIII concentrates.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nFollowing group of drugs is not the first line in the management of chronic\n* Opioids\n* Antiepileptics (Correct Answer)\n* Dopamine antagonist\n* Serotonergic drugs\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nA 52-year-old woman undergoes a sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis for recurrent diveiculitis. She returns to the emergency room 10 days later with left flank pain and decreased urine output; laboratory examination is significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 20,000/mm3 . She undergoes a CT scan that demonstrates new left hydronephrosis, but no evidence of an intraabdominal abscess. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n* Intravenous pyelogram (Correct Answer)\n* Intravenous antibiotics and repeat CT in 1 week\n* Administration of intravenous methylene blue\n* No fuher management if urinalysis is negative for hematuria\n\nExplanation: The patient should undergo an intravenous pyelogram for a suspected ureteral injury. After gynecologic surgeries, colorectal surgery is the most common cause of iatrogenic ureteral injuries. Intraoperatively, intravenous administration of methylene blue or indigocyanine green may facilitate identification of an injury. However, delay in diagnosis is common, and patients may present with flank pain, fevers, and signs of sepsis, ileus, or decreased urine output. CT scan may demonstrate hydronephrosis or a fluid collection (urinoma). Initial diagnosis and management should include urinalysis, although hematuria may not always be present; percutaneous nephrostomy tube or retrograde ureteral catheterization; percutaneous drainage of fluid collections; and identification of the location of ureteral injury. Surgical management should be delayed if diagnosis is late (10-14 days), and operative strategy is dependent on the location of the injury. Diagnostic imaging such as a pyelogram or nuclear medicine scan may be helpful to identify the site of the injury.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nLocal anaesthetic acting for more than 2 hrs – a) Bupivacianeb) Etodocainec) Lignocained) Cholorprocaine\n* ac (Correct Answer)\n* ab\n* ad\n* bc\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nAll of the following factors decrease the Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) of an inhalation anaesthetic agent except.\n* Hypothermia\n* Hyponatremia (Correct Answer)\n* Hypocalcemia\n* Anemia\n\nExplanation: C i.e. Hypocalcemia\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nWhich Endotracheal tube has preformed bend present-\n* Laser tube (Correct Answer)\n* RAE tube\n* Flexometallic tube\n* Standard tube\n\nExplanation: RAE tube with preformed bend is used for cleft lip n palate surgery.

The oral RAE is used in any surgery to facilitate directing the tubes away from the surgical field above the neck (ophthalmology, ENT or facial surgery) or for T&A with the mouth gag.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nWhich of the following is not a sign of successful stellate ganglion block –\n* Nasal stuffness\n* Guttman sign\n* Homer's syndrome (Correct Answer)\n* Bradycardia\n\nExplanation: Signs of successful stellate ganglion block :- Horner's syndrome, flushing of face, conjuctival congestion, nasal stuffiness (Guttman's sign), injection of tympanic membrane (Mueller's syndrome), increased skin temprature, lacrimation.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nModern monitors to measure ETCO2 make use of\n* Infrared absorption spectroscopy (Correct Answer)\n* Ultra violet rays\n* Laser technology\n* Scatter technology\n\nExplanation: Measurements of variations in the respiratory cycle of expired carbon dioxide by displayed waveform and by absolute numerical values is defined as Capnography and Capnometry respectivelyMeasurement of the exhaled CO2 at the level of upper airway at the end of expiration (when CO2 is at its maximum) is referred to as 3end tidal CO2 (EtCO2)Modern monitors used to measure EtCO2 in the exhaled air make use of infrared absorption spectroscopy(Refer: Morgan and Mikhail's Clinical Anaesthesiology, 5th edition, pg no. 126)\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nRelationship between myasthenia gravis and effect of neuromuscular blocker, all true except:-\n* Patients with myasthenia gravis are resistant to succinylcholine\n* They are more sensitive to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers\n* If a neuromuscular blocker is used in myasthenic patient, they should be electricity ventilated till recovery (Correct Answer)\n* Neuromuscular blockers should be avoided in these patient and if used thrice the dose of reversal agent should be given to reverse it\n\nExplanation: avoid NMBAs in patients with MG unless absolutely necessary. If NMBAs are necessary, the use of rocuroniumorvecuronium, and then reversal withsugammadex. Myasthenic patients, including those with only ocular MG and those in remission, have a variable, unpredictable response to administration of NMBAs compared with normal patients, as well as a variable response to NMBA reversal, including the possibility of cholinergic crisis. They tend to be resistant to depolarizing NMBAs and very sensitive to nondepolarizing NMBAs. In addition, treatment with anticholinesterase medication affects the degree of relaxation and duration of action of NMBAs. If NMBAs are administered, the degree of neuromuscular blockade should be monitored using a quantitative train-of-four nerve stimulator.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nThe reversal of neutromuscular blockade with d–T–C is done with –\n* Scoline (Correct Answer)\n* Neostimine\n* Atropine\n* Dantrolene\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nThe best position of endotracheal tube in trachea is:-\n* 3-4 cm above carina (Correct Answer)\n* On carina\n* Midway in trachea\n* At cricoid\n\nExplanation: The proximal tip of endotracheal tube is best kept 3-4 cm above carina.

If it is too out then accidental extubation can happen.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nThiopentone in contraindicated in all except -\n* Porphyria cuneata tarda (Correct Answer)\n* Staticus asthamaticus\n* Shock\n* Acute intermittent porphyria\n\nExplanation: Thiopentone is an barbiturate and being barbiturate it is enzyme inducers thus can precipitate porphyria But depending on enzyme affected it has been found to be safe in Porphyria cuneata tarda and absolutely contraindicated in Acute intermittent Porphyria. fuher being cardiovascular unstable it is contraindicated in shock. it is bronchoconstrictor so contraindicated in asthmatic patients .\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nWhich muscle relaxant increases intracranial pressure ?\n* Mivacurium\n* Atracurium (Correct Answer)\n* Suxamethonium\n* Vecuronium\n\nExplanation: Succinylcholine increase ICT, IOT and intra-abdominal (intragastric pressure).\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nWhile introducing the Swan-ganz catheter, its placement in the pulmonary aery can be identified by the following pressure tracing:\n* Diastolic pressure is lower in PA than in RV\n* Diatolic pressure is higher in PA than in RV (Correct Answer)\n* PA pressure tracing has diacrotic notch from closure of pulmonary valve\n* RV pressure tracing for plateau and sharp drop in early diastole\n\nExplanation: C i.e. PA pressure tracing has diacrotic notch from closure of pulmonary valve\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nOnset of post spinal headache is usually at___ hours after spinal anesthesia\n* 0-6\n* 12-Jun (Correct Answer)\n* Dec-72\n* 72-96\n\nExplanation: Post spinal headache or post dural puncture headache has onset usually on second or third day post procedure. It is an occipital type of headache, aggravated on sitting and relieved in recumbent position\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nAmong the following local anaesthetics, the one that is associated with vasoconstriction and mydriasis is :\n* Cocaine (Correct Answer)\n* Bupivacaine\n* Procaine\n* Lignocaine\n\nExplanation: Local application of cocaine causes blockage of initiation and conduction of nerve impulses. It also blocks neuronal re uptake of nor epinephrine thus potentiating adrenergic activity. Ocular effects of cocaine includes anaesthesia, mydriasis and vasoconstriction. Mydriatic effect of cocaine depends upon presence of a functioning adrenergic innervation. Procaine causes vasodilation hence it is usually given with adrenaline. The main shocomings of procaine are: Being a vasodilator, when it is given in the absence of a vasoconstrictor agent procaine is rapidly absorbed into the circulation and hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase. Hypersensitivity to procaine is commonly encountered. Ref: Clinical Ocular Pharmacology edited by Jimmy D. page 119. Principles of Pharmacology: A Tropical Approach By D. T. Okpako page 403.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nPressure of Nitrous oxide cylinder at 100% and 40% volume respectively measured by pressure gauge is:\n* 750 Psi and 500 Psi (Correct Answer)\n* 750 Psi and 750 Psi\n* 750 Psi and 375 Psi\n* 750 Psi and 275 Psi\n\nExplanation: In cases of gases which are in liquid form in cylinder ( N2O) , pressure gauze shows always full till it becomes Zero Thus in case of N2O , whether cylinder has 100% or 40% volume , pressure gauze will always show 750 Psi.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nAnaesthetic of choice for day care surgery is\n* Thiopentone\n* Nitrous oxide (Correct Answer)\n* Propofol\n* Halothane\n\nExplanation: “Propofol is parcularly suitable for day care surgery’ because residual impairment is less marked and shorter lasng Propofol\n Propofol is a milky white powder that is preservave free; therefore, it must be used within 6 hours. It is an oil based preparaon, therefore injecon is painful.\n Propofol is the most frequently used intravenous anaesthec today. — Miller 6 th /e-3l8  It can be used for both inducon as well as maintenace.\n It does not possess anconvulsive acon (unlike thiopentone),\n It causes fall in BP and bradycardia, o Like thiopental it does not possess muscle relaxant acon.\n Propofol possess significant anemec and anpruric acon. — Miller 6 th /e - 324\n Propofol decreases polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotoxis but not aherence, phagocytosis and killing (Thiopentone blocks all these) increased life threatning infecons.\n Propofol is parcularly suitable for outpaent surgery.

Rocuronium is supplied in a sterile, nonpyrogenic, isotonic solution. The isotonicity is obtained using sodium chloride, and the pH of 4 is achieved by adding acetic acid or sodium hydroxide . The pain can be decreased by prior administration of intravenous lidocaine. Rocuronium produces a burning pain in the vein or arm if administered before the loss of consciousness after induction of anesthesia. Prior administration of lidocaine may reduce the pain. Otherwise, rocuronium should be administered after induction of anesthesia and loss of consciousness.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nA 26-year-old female underwent cesarean section for a complicated pregnancy. She complains of severe occipital headache since day 2 after surgery. Headache is associated with neck pain and stiffness. Most accurate statement regarding the present clinical complaint\n* Epidural blood patch is the next step in the management.\n* It is a major complication and needs immediate intervention. (Correct Answer)\n* Seepage of CSF resulted in the present condition.\n* Early ambulation resulted in the present condition\n\nExplanation: Answer: c) Seepage of CSF resulted in the present conditionPost-spinal headacheIt is a low-pressure headache due to the seepage of CSF through the puncture site.It presents usually after 12-24 h of the spinal anesthesia.In majority of the cases, it is relieved within 1 week.It can be prevented by using small-gauge needles or dural separation needles.Adequate hydration leads to excess CSF production and prevents the post-spinal headache, which is caused by significant CSF loss (of around lOml/h).Management:First line: Includes oral analgesics and intravenous fluid administration.Second line: Includes injection of desmopressin and caffeine.Definitive treatment: Includes injection of autologous blood in the epidural space.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nSuccinylcholine can cause:\n* Hypokalemia (Correct Answer)\n* Hyperkalemia\n* Both of the above\n* None of the above\n\nExplanation: Administration of succinylcholine to an otherwise well individual for an elective surgical procedure increases plasma potassium levels by approximately 0.5 mEq/dL. This increase in potassium is due to the depolarizing action of the relaxant. With activation of the acetylcholine channels, movement of sodium into the cells is accompanied by movement of potassium out of the cells. Ref: Miller's anesthesia-7th ed, Chapter 29.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nPulse oximeter is used for monitoring –\n* Oxygen content of blood (Correct Answer)\n* Oxygen saturation\n* Partial pressure of oxygen\n* All of the above\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nFistula leading to the highest electrolyte imbalance is?\n* Gastric (Correct Answer)\n* Duodenal\n* Sigmoid\n* Rectal\n\nExplanation: Gastric REP: Sabiston 17' ed p. 324, CSDT 11th ed p. 696 Enterocutaneous fistula: Most common: iatrogenic High output > 500 ml/d The more proximal the fistula, more severe are complications.

Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L/min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44%. Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L/min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask. It is especially useful in those patients where vasoconstriction could negatively impact their condition, such as those suffering from strokes.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nWhich pulse is felt to check for return of pulse in CPCR:-\n* Carotid pulse (Correct Answer)\n* Femoral pulse\n* Brachial pulse\n* Any pulse\n\nExplanation: Carotid pulse is felt for not more than 10 sec.

Field blocko Is produced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of local anaesthetic in order to anaesthetize the region distal to the injection.o For example, subcutaneous infiltration of the proximal portion of the volar surface of the forearm results in extensive area of cutaneous anaesthesia that starts 2 to 3 cm distal to the site of injection.B. Nerve blocko LA is injected around a peripheral nerve or a plexus. Examples are -Upper limb - brachial plexus and wrist blockHead & Neck - Stellate ganglion block, trigeminal nerve block.Thorax & abdomen - Interc4ostal nerve & celiac plexuso Note - Most common complication of brachial plexus block is pneumothorax.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nMuscle pain after anaesthesia is caused by –\n* Vecuronium\n* D-tubocurare (Correct Answer)\n* Suxamethonium\n* All\n\nExplanation: Succinylcholine can cause post-operative muscle pain (myalgia, muscle soreness).\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nVasoconstriction in blood vessels is seen with:\n* Cocaine (Correct Answer)\n* Lignocaine\n* Prilocaine\n* Bupivacaine\n\nExplanation: Cocaine\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nTreatment of supraventricular tachycardia with hypotension in a patient under general anaesthesia, inludes all of the following treatments, EXCEPT:\n* Carotid sinus massage\n* Adenosine 3-12 mg IV\n* Direct current cardioversion (Correct Answer)\n* Verapamil 5 mg IV\n\nExplanation: When the patient is hemodynamically unstable DC shock can be given, adenosine is also safe if the patient has no history of asthma and has no AV block. Carotid sinus massage is also effective in most cases. If the patient has no hypotension, verapamil can be given if the patient is stable. But in this case it may aggravate the hypotension and depress ventricular function since the anesthetic itself may cause myocardial depression.

Its use has been largely replaced with that of propofol.Following intravenous injection the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes unconsciousness within 15 seconds.At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain.Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body and in about 5-10 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain such that consciousness returns.Causes hypotension and tachycardiaPrecipitates acute intermittantporphyria, hence contraindicated in PorphyriasAccidental Intra-arterial injection causes severe pain & gangrene.Can trigger Malignant HyperthermiaCerebral oxygen consumption (CMO), cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) and intracranial tension (ICT) are decreased. So, it is the intravenous agent of choice for cerebral protection.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nAnesthetic agent causing bradycardia is?\n* Gallamine\n* Vecuronium\n* Ketamine (Correct Answer)\n* Morphine\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., Morphine * Bradycardia is caused by - Succinylcholine, propofol, opioids anaesthetics (Morphine, fentanyl and its cogneres).* Tachycardia is caused by - Gallamine, Pancuronium, Rocuronium, Ketamine, Thiopentone, Methohexitone.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nDrug used for d-TC reversal is\n* Atropine\n* Atracurium\n* Diazepam (Correct Answer)\n* Neostigmine\n\nExplanation: Reversal of d tubocuraine was done by neostigmine.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nWhich drug of anesthetics causes delirium & hallucination\n* Ketamine (Correct Answer)\n* Trilene\n* Halothane\n* Trichloroethylenev\n\nExplanation: A i.e. Ketamine\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nWhich of following is hypeonic?\n* 5%dextrose\n* 0.45% normal saline\n* 0.9%normal saline (Correct Answer)\n* 3% normal saline\n\nExplanation: 3% normal saline REF: Fluids & electrolytes by By Lippincott Williams & Wilkins page 264 Isotonic Hypeonic Hypotonic Dextrose 5% in water 5% dextrose in half normal saline 0.45% normal saline 0.9% normal saline (NaC1) 5% dextrose in normal saline Ringer lactate Dextrose 10% in water\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nAll of the following statements regarding scoline apnoea are true, EXCEPT:\n* It can be inherited (Correct Answer)\n* It is caused by scopolamine\n* In recent times with proper management, the moality is very low\n* It is associated with deficiency of cholinesterase\n\nExplanation: Scoline apnea is a fatal condition which can occur with an overdose of succinylcholine. It can also occur as a genetically transmitted disorder in individuals with plasma cholinesterase activity. These patients develop apnoea even after standard dose of succinylcholine. Succinylcholine is normally inactivated by cholinesterase and in deficiency of this enzyme, there is prolonged muscle relaxing effect and patients are at high risk of developing fatal apnoea. Deficiency of this enzyme can be detected by measuring serum cholinesterase level or by estimating dibucaine number. Causes of aquired cholinesterase deficiency includes overexposure to pesticides, organophosphates or nerve gas, chronic liver disease, malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nPosition for orotracheal intubation?\n* Extension of neck and atlantoccipital joint\n* Extension of only neck\n* Flexion of neck only (Correct Answer)\n* Flexion of neck and extension of atlantoccipital joint\n\nExplanation: Ans. d (Flexion of neck and extension of atlantoccipital joint) (Ref. Head and Neck Surgery - Otolaryngology 3rd/Ch. 58)OROTRACHEAL INTUBATION# Orotracheal intubation is undertaken ideally with the patient in the sniffing position, the patient's neck flexed slightly on the chest, and the head extended slightly on the neck.# A right-handed operator directs a laryngoscope into the right aspect of the mouth with the left hand holding the scope and pushing the tongue to the left.# A Macintosh laryngoscope with a curved blade is directed into the vallecula, and the entire larynx is lifted anteriorly or ventrally to expose the glottis. A Miller laryngoscope with a straight blade is introduced under the epiglottis. It fixes the larynx at the petiole of the epiglottis and lifts the larynx anteriorly to expose the glottis.# Other varieties of laryngoscopes now exist, but the Macintosh and the Miller are the most likely to be found on an emergency cart.# The right hand is used to insert the endotracheal tube, which should not be overly tight in the glottis. In children, an air leak around the tube is desirable.# Slight pressure on the cricoid cartilage by an assistant sometimes helps to visualize the larynx. This maneuver also can help to prevent aspiration of gastric contents by pressing the cricoid cartilage backward against the vertebral column to close the esophagus and help prevent regurgitation. This technique is desirable when a patient has a full stomach.TracheostomyFollowing induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the patient is positioned with a combination of head extension and placement of an appropriate sandbag under the shoulders. There should be no rotation of the head. Children's heads should nor be overextended as it is possible to enter the trachea in the fifth or sixth rings under thesecircumstances.REVIEW OF AIRWAY TECHNIQUES (Temporizing/Adjunctive Measures)# Chin lift/jaw thrust to open airway - caveat: no neck extension if suspected C-spine injury# Bag-valve-mask ventilation - probably the most important, yet under-appreciated, skill of airway management. In the ED, when bagging, use a two-hands on the mask technique for a tight seal, and always use an oral airway# Suctioning/removal of foreign bodies# Nasal airway - generally well-tolerated by the temporarily obtunded patient (e.g. post-ictal, post-procedural sedation, intoxicated)# Oral airway - aids in peri-intubation ventilation; not to be used in patient with intact gag reflex# Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) - this device is inserted into the mouth and has a cuff that occludes the hypopharynx. It has a port through which ventilation can then occur. A variation is the Intubating LMA - this allows the insertion of an endotracheal tube via the ventilation port. The LMA is used both as a rescue device in failed intubation, and as a primary airway device# Needle cricothyroidotomy - accomplished by inserting a needle in cricothyroid membrane, and oxygenating the patient using high pressure oxygen source\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nAll of the following are true statements regarding drugs to be discontinued before surgery except :\n* Thyroid medications need not be stopped before surgery (Correct Answer)\n* NSAIDs should be discontinued 72 hours before surgery\n* Warfarin should be discontinued 4 days before surgery\n* MAO Inhibitors should be discontinued 2 weeks before surgery\n\nExplanation: The following drugs has tobe continued on the day of surgery: Antihypeensive medications Cardiac medications (e.g.,b-blockers, digoxin) Antidepressants, anxiolytics, and other psychiatric medications Thyroid medications Anticonvulsantmedications Asthma medications. Steroids (oral and inhaled) Drugs that should be discontinued on the day of surgery Oral hypoglycemic agents NSAIDs - Discontinue 48 hours before the day of surgery Warfarin - Discontinue 4 days before surgery, except for patients having cataract surgery without a bulbar block. Sho acting Insulins except when given by a continuous pump Thienopyridines (e.g., clopidogrel, ticlopidine) except in cataract surgery, patients with metallic/drug eluting stents Aspirin in selected cases where reversal of platelet inhibition is necessary MAO Inhibitors - 2 weeks prior (MAO Inhibitors are usually continued.They should be discontinued if the patient and anesthesiologist factors are not orable to continue them)\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nAll are the methods of Aerial blood pressure monitoring except\n* Capnography (Correct Answer)\n* Radial aery cannulation\n* Oscillometry\n* Aerial Tonometry\n\nExplanation: Cardiovascular monitoring Noninvasive Aerial Blood Pressure monitoring methods : Palpation Doppler Auscultation Oscillometry Aerial Tonometry Invasive Aerial Blood Pressure monitoring method Aerial cannulation ( eg : radial, ulnar, femoral ,etc) Pulmonary aery catheterization Central venous catheterization Cardiac output measurement Thermodilution Dye Dilution Pulse Contour Devices Esophageal Doppler Thoracic Bioimpedance Fick Principle Echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) Capnography : It is Non Cardiovascular monitoring method\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nOptimum minute ventilation is ensured by adjusting the following ventilation parameters\n* PEEP and FiO2 (Correct Answer)\n* Tidal volume and respiratory rate\n* PEEP and respiratory rate\n* Tidal volume and PEEP\n\nExplanation: Minute ventilation is tidal volume multiplied by respiratory rate.so these parameters must be adjusted to maintain optimum ventilation.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nThe most common side effect of neuraxial opioid is:\n* Nausea & vomiting (Correct Answer)\n* Pruritus\n* Urinary retention\n* Sedation\n\nExplanation: Pruritus is the most common side effect with neuraxial opioids. It may be generalized but is more likely to be localized to the face, neck or upper thorax. Treatment 1. naloxone 2. antihistaminic. 3. propofol\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nAll are methods of regional anaesthesia except -\n* Topical anaesthesia\n* Bier's block\n* Nerve block (Correct Answer)\n* Total intravenous anaesthesia\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., Total intravenous anaesthesia Regional anaesthesia (Local anaesthesia)o Regional anaesthesia means loss of sensation in body part without the loss of consciousness or the impairment of central control of vital function.o Methods are:1. Topical anaesthesia (surface anaesthesia)2. Infiltration anaesthesia3. Intravenous regional anaesthesia (Bier's block)4. Conduction block (either field block or nerve block).5. Spinal anaesthesia6.

His weight has been rising, his lungs show rales at both bases, and he is dyspneic. His fractional excretion of sodium is greater than 1. He has eosinophilia on his peripheral smear, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and proteinuria with microscopic hematuria. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his renal failure?\n* Hypovolemia (Correct Answer)\n* Renal aery cholesterol embolism\n* Acute tubular necrosis\n* Cardiogenic shock\n\nExplanation: Cholesterol atheroembolism is a known complication of angiography or aoic manipulation during surgery and can result in lower extremity ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, ischemic bowel, and acute or chronic renal failure. Eosinophilia is strongly suggestive of cholesterol atheroembolization, and other laboratory findings include microscopic hematuria or proteinuria and elevated inflammatory mediators such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of greater than 1 suggests a renal cause of acute renal failure as opposed to prerenal causes such as hypovolemia or cardiogenic shock. Thoracic aoic dissections can result in acute renal failure if they involve the renal aeries and may present with hematuria and elevations in BUN and creatinine. However, aoic dissections are typically associated with significant chest pain.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nWhich one of the following agents sensitizes the myocardium to catecholamines?\n* Ether\n* Propofol\n* Isoflurane (Correct Answer)\n* Halothane\n\nExplanation: Halothane is an inhalational anaesthetic which sensitizes the myocardium to catecholamines and it produce severe ventricular arrhythmias. Other cardiovascular effects of halothane includes: 1.depression of myocardial contractility, 2.fall in blood pressure and cardiac output, and 3.predisposition to the development of re entrant tachyarrhythmias.

It may be :-1) Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)# PEEP is the positive pressure is applied at the end of expiration during mechanical ventilation. So, PEEP has two features : -i) Positive pressure is applied during expiration (at the end).ii) Used for mechanical ventilation2) Continuous positive Airway pressure (CPAP)# CPAP is application of positive-pressure : -i) During both inspiration and expiration.ii) In spontaneous breathingPulmonary effects of PEEP and CPAP* Positive pressure in PEEP 8c CPAP results in : -i) Re-expansion (recruitment) and stabilization of partially collapsed lung, which causes : -a) Increased FRC, tidal volume & lung compliance.b) Correction of ventilation!perfusion abnormalities - Improved oxygenation.ii) Redistribution ofextravascular lung water from interstitial space between alveoli and endothelial cells towards peri-bronchial and perihilar areas - As fluid moves away from the space between vessels & alveolar space, oxygen can diffuse more easily from alveoli into the blood - Improved arterial oxygenation.Adverse effects of PEEP/CPAP1. Pulmonary* Controlled PEEP or CPAP improve lung compliance and correct ventilation/perfusion abnormalities. However, excessive PEEP or CPAP can overdistend alveoli & bronchi which results in : -i) Increased dead space ventilationii) Reduced lung complianceiii) Increased pulmonary vascular resistance & Right ventricular afterload.iv) Barotrauma (Pneumothorax, pneumopericardium, pneumoperitonium, Subcutaneous emphysema).2. Extrapulmonary* These adverse effects are primary circulatory and are related to transmission of elevated airway pressure to the chest :-i) Decreased cardiac output (due to increased intrathoracic pressure venous return is decreased).ii) Decreased hepatic & renal blood flow (due to decreased cardiac output 8c elevated CVP)iii) Increased ADH & angiotensiniv) Decreased urinary output, GFR and free water clearance (Decrease Renal function).v) Increased ICT (due to increased CVP).\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nSclera buckling is used for treatment of ?\n* Cataract\n* Scleritis (Correct Answer)\n* Retinal detachment\n* Vitreous hemorrhage\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Retinal detachment Treatment of retinal detachment Retinal detachment surgery consists of three components : sealing retinal tears, reducing the vitreous traction on the retina and flattening of retina. It is impoant to find all retinal tears (holes) and seal them by laser photocoagulation, diathermy or cryoapplication. Scleral buckeling or external plombage or encirclage is a procedure to push the wall of sclera inwards to close the tear, reduce the traction and flatten the retina. Drainage of subretinal fluid helps to flatten the retina against the sclera. Intravitreal surgery (vitrectomy and gas injection) may also be employed.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nIntraocular pressure is increased by which anaesthetic?\n* Ketamine (Correct Answer)\n* Propofol\n* N20\n* Isoflurane\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ketamine\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nTrue about local anaesthetic agents\n* Duration depends on protein binding\n* Potency depends upon lipid solubility\n* LA with low PK is more active (Correct Answer)\n* All\n\nExplanation: All i.e. A, B, C\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nMost common arrhythmia associated with succinylcholine:-\n* Ventricular tachycardia (Correct Answer)\n* Sinus bradycardia\n* Torsado de pointes\n* Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia\n\nExplanation: Sinus bradycardia is most common arrhythmia associated with succinylcholine. Succinylcholine is dicholine ester i.e. two molecules of acetylcholine. If it reaches cardiac muscarinic receptor then it can cause bradycardia and arrythmias. In contrast to actions at cardiac muscarinic cholinergic receptors the effect of succinylcholine at autonomic nervous system causes tachycardia and hypeension\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nPungent volatile anesthetic agents are:\n* Halthane (Correct Answer)\n* Isoflurane\n* Sevoflurane\n* Desflurane\n\nExplanation: B i.e. Isoflurane\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nTrue about modified Post Anaesthesia Discharge Scoring System (PADSS) is all except\n* In modified PADSS the parameter vital sign should always have a score 2 (Correct Answer)\n* Maximum score is 10 and 8 or more is required for discharge\n* There are six parameters to be seen\n* Apa from vital signs other parameter should have a score 1\n\nExplanation: Six parameters of PADSS* Vital signs* Surgical bleeding* Voiding* Postoperative nausea/ vomiting* Pain* Ambulation Each criterion is given a score ranging from 0 to 2 Maximum score is 12 If 9 or more - we discharge the patient Modified PADSS Vital signs criteria must never score lower than 2 None of the other five criteria must ever be = 0, even if the total score reaches 9.

It is most cardiotoxic local anesthetic (Ref: Katzung 11/e p239)LidocaineMOA: Blocks both activated and inactivated Na+ channels with rapid kineticsQ.Pharmacokinetics: Has extensive first pass hepatic metabolismQ, only 3% of orally administered lidocaine appears in the plasma.Most physicians administer IV lidocaine only to patients with arrhythmias.Lidocaine ToxicityLidocaine is the least cardiotoxicQ of currently used Na+ channel blocker.Other side effects are:Neurologic: Paraesthesia, tremorsLight headedness.Hearing disturbancesSlurred speechConvulsionsUses of LidocaineVentricular tachycardiaQPrevention of ventricular fibrillationQLocal AnestheticsAminoesters (single 'i')Aminoamides (double 'i')* Procaine* Chlorprocaine* Tetracaine* Benzocaine* Cocaine* Esters are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase (except cocaine which is metabolized by liver)* High incidence of allergic reactions which are because of para aminobenzoic acid* Solutions are not stable* Lignocaine* Mepivacaine* Prilocaine* Bupivacaine* Etidocaine* Ropivacaine* Amides are metabolized primarily in liver.* Low incidence of allergic reactions* Solutions are stable (Not destroyed even by autoclaving)Local Anesthetics: Mechanism of actionLA blocks Na+ channel from insideQ of cell membrane and raises the threshold of channel openingQ.Resting nerve is resistant to block and blockage develop rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedlyQ.High Ca2+ conc, lessens the degree of block.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nA 25 year old primigravide with mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation is under labor. She wants normal delivery which would be the best way to provide analgesia in this lady\n* Inhalational analgesia\n* Intravenous opioids\n* Spinal anesthesia (Correct Answer)\n* Neuraxialblockde analgesia\n\nExplanation: D i.e. Neuraxialblockde analgesia Epidural (neuraxial) analgesia is the most effective and least depressant method of intrapaum pain relief and is often viewed as technique choice for relief of labor painQ. It blunts the hemodynamic effects of contractions and associated pain response, which is desirable for patients with hypeensive disorders, asthma, diabetes, and cardiac and intracardiac neurovascular diseaseQ\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nThe anaesthetic that affects the laryngeal & pharyngeal reflexes minimally –\n* Propanidid\n* Methohexitane\n* Thiopentone (Correct Answer)\n* Ketamine\n\nExplanation: Airway reflexes (pharyngeal & laryngeal) are not depressed → can be used for emergency anaesthesia.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nA Patient is on regular medications for co-existing medical problems. Which of the following drugs may be stopped safely with minimal risk of adverse effects before an abdominal surgery –\n* Statins\n* Bta Blockers (Correct Answer)\n* ACE inhibitors/ACE Receptor Blockers\n* Steroids\n\nExplanation: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers should be discontinued 12 to 24 hours before surgery if taken only for hypertension, as they may produce hypotension, which is not responsive to conventional vasopressors.\nStatins, Beta Blockers and Steroids should not be stopped abruptly before surgery as their abrupt discontinuation may increase the risk of serious (even life-threatening) complications.\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nArmoured Endotracheal tube is used in:\n* Pediatric surgery (Correct Answer)\n* Neurosurgery\n* Cardiac surgery\n* Thoraxic surgery\n\nExplanation: Neurosurgery\n\n## Question from Anaesthesia:\nA 38 year old man is posted for extraction of last molar tooth under general anaesthesia as a day care case. He wishes to resume his work after 6 hours. Which one of the following induction agents is preferred?\n* Propofol (Correct Answer)\n* Ketamine\n* Diazepam\n* Thiopentone sodium\n\nExplanation: Propofol has replaced the barbiturates for induction of anesthesia in the ambulatory setting because of its orable recovery profile. Recovery after induction of anesthesia with propofol is faster than with the barbiturate compounds and it is associated with low incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting. Ref: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology By K D Tripathi, 5th Edition, Page 344 ; Miller's Anesthesia, 6th Edition, Pages 2602-3\n\n## Question from Anatomy:\nThe arachnoid villi allow cerebrospinal fluid to pass between which two of the following spaces?\n* Choroid plexus and subdural space (Correct Answer)\n* Subarachnoid space and superior sagittal sinus\n* Subdural space and cavernous sinus\n* Superior sagittal sinus and jugular vein\n\nExplanation: The arachnoid villi are extensions of the arachnoid mater into the superior sagittal sinus. The villi allow for proper drainage of the CSF into the venous bloodstream from the subarachnoid space in which the CSF circulates. The villi are a crucial element in maintaining proper intracranial pressure and circulation of the CSF.\n\n## Question from Anatomy:\nA 47-year-old woman with a family history of breast cancer mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes has made a decision to have an elective hysterectomy as a prophylactic treatment. During ligation of the uterine artery which of the following adjacent structures must the surgeon be careful not to injure?\n* Ureter (Correct Answer)\n* Internal iliac artery\n* Internal iliac lymph nodes\n* Obturator nerve\n\nExplanation: During a hysterectomy, ligation of or injury to the ureter can happen relatively easily because it is the most susceptible structure due to its location. The ureter is located below the uterine vessels in the pelvic cavity approximately 1 cm lateral to the supravaginal cervix. The internal iliac artery bifurcates near the pelvic brim but is not in close proximity to the uterine vessels in the vicinity of the cervix. The obturator nerve travels along the pelvic sidewall and is not close to the site of ligation of the uterine vessels.

Combined laparoscopic and MRI examinations reveal tears of the ligaments supporting the uterus with moderate uterine prolapse. Which of the following ligaments provides direct support to the uterus and thereby resists prolapse?\n* Uterosacral (Correct Answer)\n* Round ligament of the uterus\n* Broad ligament\n* Arcus tendineus fascia pelvis\n\nExplanation: The uterosacral ligaments and the transverse cervical (cardinal) ligaments are the two main ligaments stabilizing the uterus. They help to inhibit the uterus from prolapsing into the vagina. The round ligament of the uterus is related to the descent of the ovaries in embryologic development and continues into the inguinal canal. The broad ligament is the peritoneal covering over the uterine tubes, uterus, and vessels. The arcus tendineus fascia pelvis joins the muscle fascia of the levator ani to the pubocervical fascia on the vagina and is not directly associated with the uterus or its ligaments. The levator ani muscles contribute to the floor of the pelvis and support all of the pelvic viscera indirectly; it does not, however, prevent prolapse of the uterus into the vagina.\n\n## Question from Anatomy:\nSuprarenal gland develops from -\n* Metanephros\n* Ureteric bud (Correct Answer)\n* Neural crest\n* Endodem\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Neural crest o Suprarenal (adrenal) gland consists two part :Superficial cortex : Derived from coelomic epithelium (mesodermal).Deepar medulla : Derived from neural crest (ectodermal).\n\n## Question from Anatomy:\nA 28-year-old pregnant woman is admitted to the obstetrics department for delivery.

The most appropriate treatment is\n* Radical excision (Correct Answer)\n* Microdochectomy\n* Radical mastectomy\n* Biopsy to rule out carcinoma\n\nExplanation: Discharges from the nipple Discharge can occur from one or more lactiferous ducts. Management depends on the presence of blood in the discharge or discharge from a single duct. Treatment Treatment must firstly be to exclude a carcinoma by occult blood test and cytology. Simple reassurance may then be sufficient but, if the discharge is proving intolerable, an operation to remove the affected duct or ducts can be performed (microdochectomy). MICRODOCHECTOMY It is impoant not to express the blood before the operation as it may then be difficult to identify the duct in theatre. A lacrimal probe or length of stiff nylon suture is inseed into the duct from which the discharge is emerging. A tennis racquet incision can be made to encompass the entire duct or a periareolar incision used and the nipple flap dissected to reach the duct. The duct is then excised. A papilloma is nearly always situated within 4-5cm of the nipple orifice. Ductoscopy (inspection of the internal structure of the duct system) using microendoscopes is technically feasible but generally disappointing. The affected duct may not be visualised and biopsy systems are currently rudimentary.

In anticodon, the first nucleotide of anticodon of tRNA is not specific or the nucleotide towards 5' end of anticodon is not specific. This is Wobble phenomenon. This explains how can 1 codon code for more than one aminoacid (Degeneracy of codon).* Acceptor arm is so called, because it is this arm which accepts the aminoacid. This arm has a triplet nucleotide \"CCA\" attached to the 3' end of tRNA. It is to the A of this CCA, to which aminoacid gets attached. This CCA triplet nucleotide is common to all the tRNAs, when all the other sequences are unique to a particular tRNA.TpsC arm* The arm through which the tRNA gets attached to ribosome,D arm* The arm through which aminoacyl tRNA synthetases get attached.# For every aminoacid, we have a specific aminoacyl tRNA synthetase# Once the enzymes - aminoacyl tRNA synthetases get activated, they go to the aminoacid pool. They pick up the specific aminoacid and activate the specific aminoacid using 2 high energy phosphates.# The activated aminoacids are carried by the respective enzymes and they go to the tRNA pool.# In the tRNA pool, they get attached to the tRNAs through D arm# Then they scan the anticodon arm, if the specific anticodon is found, the aminoacid is attached to acceptor arm.* Hence choice b, D arm is for ribosomal attachment is false. D arm is for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases attachment.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nNorthern blot test is used for\n* DNA analysis (Correct Answer)\n* RNA analysis\n* Analysis of proteins\n* Enzyme analysis\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e. RNA analysis: Northern blot is used for - RNA analysis*Southern blot is used for - DNA analysis*Western blot is used for - Protein analysis*Mnemonic:South is Down on the globe.

It involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light; typically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique isabsorption spectroscopy.Although the RIA technique is extremely sensitive and extremely specific, requiring specialized equipment, it remains among the least expensive methods to perform such measurements. It requires special precaution and licensing, since radioactive substances are used. The unique ability of RIA to measure small molecules can nowadays be achieved in many cases by non-radioactive methods such as ELISA, where the antigen-antibody reaction is measured using colorimetric, such as absorbance, fluorescence intensity or polarization. This, combined with the usual sandwich configuration of ELISA requiring two domains of an analyte to be present to generate a signal, has led to many assays being developed for ELISA instead of RIA or for RIA assays to be replaced by ELISA.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nStrength and rigidity in keratin is due to -\n* Leucine (Correct Answer)\n* Cysteine\n* Lithium\n* None of the above\n\nExplanation: Keratin is a protein present in the hair, nails and outer layer of skin. Keratin is almost completely comprised of alpha-helices (secondary structure) Two alpha helix are wound around one another to form super helix.

These difficulties occur because of which one of the following?\n* An inability of the lung to contract to exhale (Correct Answer)\n* An inability of the lung to expand when taking in air\n* An inability of the lung to respond to insulin\n* An inability of the lung to respond to glucagon\n\nExplanation: The baby has respiratory distress syndrome, caused by an inability to produce surfactant, a hydrophobic molecule that is secreted by the type II cells in the lung and coats the airways, reducing surface tension during contraction and allowing relatively easy expansion of the lung during inhalation. This is due to the lungs not yet producing surfactant, which contains a few proteins and a large amount of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. Respiratory distress syndrome is not related to insulin or glucagon response by the lung, or the ability of the lung cells to generate energy.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nMetachromatic leukodystrophy is due to deficiency of\n* Hexosaminidase A\n* Hexosaminidase B\n* Ceramidase (Correct Answer)\n* Arylsulfatase\n\nExplanation: DiseaseEnzyme deficiencySymptomsMetachromaticleukodystrophyArylsulfatase AMental retardation and psychologic disturbances in adults; demyelinationRef: Harper&;s Biochemistry; 30th edition; Chapter 24 Metabolism of Acylglycerols & Sphingolipids\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nTwo transgenic plants were genetically engineered using Recombinant DNA technology.

Wrong statement about this graph is:\n* The curve is hyperbolic in shape.\n* \"?\" here represents Km of the enzyme (Correct Answer)\n* At point C only a small amount of the enzyme is present as the Enzyme-Substrate complex.\n* At point C, Vi is independent of\n\nExplanation: This is Michaelis Menten graph (rectangular hyperbola shape). Km is Michaelis Menten constant. Km is that substrate concentration at which velocity of reaction is half of Vmax. Here '?' point represents Km (on X-axis). At point C, maximum amount of enzyme is present as E-S complex --- so option C is wrong Initial poion of this graph has first order kinetics i.e. velocity is directly propoional to substrate concentration Later poion of the graph has zero order kinetics i.e. velocity is independent of substrate concentration\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nAmong the following food items, which one has the highest \"Glycemic Index\"?\n* Corn flakes (Correct Answer)\n* Brown rice\n* Ice-cream\n* Whole wheat bread\n\nExplanation: The increase in blood glucose after a test dose of a carbohydrate compared with that after an equivalent amount of glucose is known as the glycemic index. Glycemic Index decreasing order: Corn flakes> whole wheat bread>Brown rice>Ice cream Most varieties of legumes, pasta, fruits, and dairy products are low-GI foods (55 or less on the glucose reference scale). Breads, breakfast cereals, rice, and snack products, including whole-grain versions, are available in both high- (70 or greater) and low-GI forms. Glucose and galactose have an index of 1 (or 100%), as do lactose, maltose, isomaltose, and trehalose, which give rise to these monosaccharides on hydrolysis. Fructose and the sugar alcohols are absorbed less rapidly and have a lower glycemic index, as does sucrose. The glycemic index of starch varies between near 1 (or 100%) and near 0 as a result of variable rates of hydrolysis, and that of non-starch polysaccharides is 0. Foods that have a low glycemic index are considered to be more beneficial since they cause less fluctuation in insulin secretion.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nReaction occuring in conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine?\n* Hydroxylation\n* Oxidation\n* Glucuronidation (Correct Answer)\n* Methylation\n\nExplanation: Ans.

Rather, muscle glycogen acts as a source of energy; the glucose-6-phosphate enters the glycolysis to produce energy.Difference between muscle and liver glycogenolysisMuscleLivero Little glucose is formed, since glucose-6-phosphatase is absento Free glucose forms by glucose-6-phosphataseo Stimulated by adrenaline, glucagon has no effecto Glucagon is major stimulator of glycogenolysiso Stimulated by AMP but inhibited by glucose-6-phosphateo No effect of AMP, but hepatic glycogen phosphorylase is inhibited by glucose\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nEhlers-Darlos syndrome characterized by hypermobile joints and skin abnormalities is due to:\n* Abnormality in gene for procollagen (Correct Answer)\n* Deficiency of lysyl oxidase\n* Deficiency of prolyl hydroxylase\n* Deficiency of lysyl hydroxylase\n\nExplanation: Ans. A. Abnormality in gene for procollagenEhlers-Danlos syndrome comprises a group of inherited disorders whose principal clinical features are hyperextensibility of the skin, abnormal tissue fragility, and increased joint mobility. The clinical picture is variable, reflecting underlying extensive genetic heterogeneity. At least 10 types have been recognized, most but not all of which reflect a variety of lesions in the synthesis of collagen. Type IV is the most serious because of its tendency for spontaneous rupture of arteries or the bowel, reflecting abnormalities in type III collagen. Patients with type VI due to a deficiency of lysyl hydroxylase, exhibit marked joint hypermobility and a tendency to ocular rupture. A deficiency of procollagen N- proteinase, causing formation of abnormal thin, irregular collagen fibrils, results in type VII C manifested by marked joint hypermobility and soft skin.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nVitamin D from the skin or diet is metabolized primarily in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamine D3. What is the rate limiting enzyme in Vitamin D synthesis?\n* 25 cholecalciferol (Correct Answer)\n* 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol\n* 24, 25- dihydroxycholecalciferol\n* 7-dehydrocholesterol\n\nExplanation: Vitamin D from the skin or diet is metabolized primarily in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamine D3. 25D is the 'storage' form of vitamin D and is used to determine the vitamin D status of individuals. The last and rate limiting step in the synthesis of 'active' 1,25D is catalyzed by the mitochondrial enzyme 1 hydroxylase and is conventionally known to take place in kidneys.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nA 48-year-old right-handed man was admitted with a 3-day history of brief generalised tonic-clonic seizures,muscle weakness, a 3-month history of weight loss with increasing difficulty in eating and a 1-week history of word finding difficulties and speech apraxia with reduced fine motor skills.He had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, epilepsy and a history of a left temporal lobe infarct 3 years ago.

This genetic disease results from deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase and has an incidence in the American population of approximately 1 in 100,000 bihs.Ref: DM Vasudevan, 7th edition, page no: 128\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nIn traumatic brain injury, changes in brain metabolism are seen. All are true EXCEPT\n* There is a decrease of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity\n* There is accumulation of lactate in brain\n* There is | lactate uptake from circulation (Correct Answer)\n* | CSF lactate is associated with good prognosis\n\nExplanation: In Traumatic brain injury anaerobic condition prevails. So brain cells switch to anerobic metabolism producing increasing amount of lactate (Option B is correct). Now if this lactate is getting utilized as energy source within brain cells through TCA it is associated with good prognosis (means tissue is recovering from injury), However, if the lactate is not getting utilized in brain cells and it will be expoed out from cell in to CSF. This outcome means severe damage to brain cells so that they are not able to utilize lactate. Hence increased lactate levels in CSFare associated with poor prognosis. (but D is wrong) Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is decreased due to hypoxic conditions. (Option A is correct) Now if this lactate is getting utilized as energy source within brain cells through TCA it is associated with good prognosis (means tissue is recovering from injury). However, if the lactate is not getting utilized in brain cells and it will be expoed out from cell in to CSF. This outcome means severe damage to brain cells so that they are not able to utilize lactate. Hence increased lactate levels in CSF are associated with poor prognosis. (but D is wrong) Also, increase lactate uptake from the circulation into brain cells is seen as the injured brain uses lactate as fuel. (Option C is correct)\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nWhich arm of tRNA binds it to vibosomal surface\n* DHU arm (Correct Answer)\n* Pseudouridine arm\n* Acceptor arm\n* Anticodon arm\n\nExplanation: Pseudoridine arm of tRNA is involved in binding of aminoacyl tRNA to ribosomal surface.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\n\"Reducing power\" is usually in the form of:\n* Reduced NADP+ (Correct Answer)\n* Reduced NADPH\n* Reduced NAD\n* Oxidised NADH\n\nExplanation: NADP?: Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate, is a diffusible electron carrier. Its reduced form (NADPH) is reducing power of the cell. A cells reservoir of NADPH represents its reducing power which is an impoant measure of cells usable energy. They store electrons until they are used in anabolic reactions. A cells reservoir of NADPH represents its reducing power which is an impoant measure of cells usable energy. Functions of NADPH: Synthesis of fatty acids, Synthesis of cholesterol, Fixation of ammonia by glutamate dehydrogenase, Oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes: - Generation of catecholamine mediators (dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine), - Drug metabolism, Generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species by phagocytes, Scavenging of reactive oxygen species that form as byproducts of oxygen transpo and of the respiratory chain.

Ascorbate, uric acid and a variety of polyphenols derived from plant foods act as water-soluble radical trapping antioxidants, forming relatively stable radicals that persist long enough to undergo reaction to non-radical products. Ubiquinone and carotenes similarly act as lipid-soluble radical-trapping antioxidants in membranes and plasma lipoproteins. Lipid peroxides are also reduced to fatty acids by reaction with vitamin E.

The local environment of the protein can raise this pKa value closer to 7 such that the histidine side chains within Hb will be the major groups that accept and donate protons when Hb acts as a buffer. The alanine side chain (a methyl group) cannot accept or donate protons. The pKa for the side chains of serine or threonine are above 10.0, so at physiologic pH, these side chains are always protonated and cannot act as a binding site for excess protons generated during an acidotic event. The pKa for the side chain of aspartate is about 4.0, so at physiologic pH, that group is always deprotonated and will not accept protons generated during an acidotic event.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nAll of the following are glycoproteins, EXCEPT:\n* TSH\n* FSH\n* LH (Correct Answer)\n* GH\n\nExplanation: Growth hormone or somatotropin is a 191-amino-acid polypeptide hormone (MW 21,500) synthesized and secreted by the somatotrophs of the anterior pituitary.

Glucagon given. It raises blood glucose if given after meals But does not raises blood glucose if given during fasting. Liver biopsy shows increased glycogen deposits. Enzyme defect is ?\n* Muscle phosphorylase\n* Glucose-6-phosphatase\n* Branching enzyme (Correct Answer)\n* Debranching enzyme\n\nExplanation: This patient has Debranching enzyme deficiency, also known as limit dextrinosis or Cori's Disease. Normally this enzyme releases just 10% glucose. So the patient has only early morning hypoglycemia in its deficiency i.e. mild hypoglycemia. (No hypoglycemia during the daytime, when meals are taken). Limit dextrins (a branched oligosaccharide having lots of alpha 1--> 6 bonds) are accumulated in this patient's liver during fasting so if glucagon given during fasting, phosphorylase (rate-limiting enzyme of glycogenolysis, which is activated by Glucagon) will be activated which cannot break limit dextrins. Phosphorylase enzyme can only break alpha 1--> 4 bonds. So this will not raise blood glucose. In fed state glycogen is formed. So if glucagon is given during fed state, phosphorylase will be activated which can break glycogen (has both alpha 1--> 4 & alpha 1-->6 glycosidic bonds) & can raise blood glucose. In von Gierke's disease, if glucagon is given, blood glucose will not be increased and in this disease, the patient has severe hypoglycemia as both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis cannot occur due to deficiency of Glucose-6-phosphatase - So, Option B is not the answer.\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nDecarboxylation of which of the following amino acids results in formation of a vasodilator:\n* Valine\n* Arginine (Correct Answer)\n* Histidine\n* Glutamic acid\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nTransfer of an amino group from an amino acid to an alpha keto acid is done by?\n* Transaminases (Correct Answer)\n* Aminases\n* Transketolase\n* Decarboxylase\n\nExplanation: Ans:A.)TransaminaseTransaminase (Amino-transferases) transfer an a-amino (NH3+) group from L amino acid to an alpha keto acid.OVERVIEW OF AMINO ACID DEGRADATION* There are several steps involved in the degradation of amino acids.1. The a-amino group must be removed from the amino acid. This can be done either transamination or oxidative deamination .In transamination, enzymes, known as aminotransferases, act to remove the amino group from specific amino acids and transfer them to another molecule.Almost every amino acid has a specific aminotransferase. ALT: Transfers amino group from alanine to a-ketoglutarate, resulting in the formation of glutamate and pyruvate.AST: Transfers amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate, resulting in the formation of aspaate and a-ketoglutarate. Oxidative deamination acts to remove the amino group from glutamate and release it as ammonia.Stimulators: ADP and GDP activate glutamate dehydrogenase.Inhibitors: ATP and GTP inhibit glutamate dehydrogenase.2. Once the a-amino group is removed from the amino acid, the ammonia moiety must then be transpoed to the liver for metabolism into urea. This transpo occurs with the help of alanine and glutamine..3. Once in the liver, the ammonia moiety is transformed into urea the urea cycle .4. The remaining carbon skeleton are then degraded into intermediates of the citric acid cycle or can be used as building blocks for other molecules .5. The branched-chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine) require specific enzyme complexes in order to be fully degraded .\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nNet ATP's formed in glycolysis are:\n* 5 (Correct Answer)\n* 8\n* 10\n* 15\n\nExplanation: 8\n\n## Question from Biochemistry:\nAll of the following statements about LDL are true except:\n* It delivers cholesterol to cells\n* It contains only one Apoprotein\n* It is a marker for cardiovascular disease (Correct Answer)\n* It contains Apo-B4\n\nExplanation: D i.e. It contains Apo-B4LDL has highest cholesterol and cholesteryl ester contentQ and possesses only apo B-100 as their major apoproteinQ. Its primary function is to provide cholesterol (whether dietary or endogenous) to peripheral (extrhepatic) tissueQ.

Tympanosclerosis may be classified as : - Myringosclerosis : - Involving only the tympanic membrane. Intratympanic tympanosclerosis : - Involving other middle ear sites : ossicular chain or, rarely, the mastoid cavity. Exact etiology of tympanosclerosis is not known. It may be an abnormal healing process and most commonly occurs in cases of serous otitis media as a complication of ventilation tube (gourmet) inseion. Characteristic chalky white patches are seen on inspection of the eardrum. It is woh noting that cholesteatoma may look similar but the whiteness appears behind, rather than in/on the tympanum. Otherwise tympanosclerosis is asymptomatic. Conductive hearing loss may occur in some cases.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nNot true about Angiofibroma\n* Arise from fossa of Rossenmullar (Correct Answer)\n* Sessions / Radowski classification used\n* Frog face deformity\n* Biopsy is contraindicated\n\nExplanation: Arises from Sphenopalatine Foramen.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nThe most common cause of epiglottitis in children aged 5 yrs is?\n* H. influnzae (Correct Answer)\n* N meningitides\n* Streptococci\n* Pneumococci\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., H. influnzae Epiglottitis It is the inflammation of epiglottis with inflammatory edema of hyopharynx. It is a true medical emergency. H.influenzae is the most common causative organism. Other organisms are Pneumococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, N.meningitidis, Staphylococcus Clinical manifestations Onset is sudden. Symptoms are- fever, dysphagia, drooling, muffled voice, inspiratory retractions, cyanosis and soft stridor. Patients often sit in sniffing dog position. Respiratory arrest may occur. Plain lateral soft tissue radiograph of neck Thickening of the epiglottis - the thumb sign Absence of a deep well defined vallecula - the vallecula sign \"The risk of sudden death for persons is high due to sudden airway obstruction\". Diagnosis of acute epiglottitis In most cases presumptive diagnosis can be made by typical clinical picture of the disease. The definitive diagnosis is made by direct inspection of the epiglottis, a procedure that should be done by an experienced airway specialist under controlled conditions (usually the operating room). The typical findings are cherry-red and swollen epiglottis and arytenoids. In children, the epiglottis can be seen by simple depression of tongue by tongue blade. In older children and adults, indirect or direct laryngoscopy usually is necessory to make a diagnosie\"\". Though the definitive diagnosis requires direct inspection of the epiglottis. Case management should be individualized. In the child with moderate or advanced disease, the clinical diagnosis should be apparent without an intraoral examination. In this situation, intraoral examination should not be performed, but the child should be prepared for the establishment of an airway. This preparation should be rapid but controlled so that intubation can be performed in an operating room. The diagnosis can also be established by the classical appearance on a lateral neck radiograph which shows the thumb sign and vellecula sign. Etiological diagnosis is made by culture of an organism from blood and from the specimen of the surface of epiglottis. Treatment of epiglottitis Once the diagnosis of epiglottitis is made, endotracheal intubation must be performed immediately. After an airway is established, cultures of the blood and epiglottis should be obtained and patient staed on appropriate intravenous antibiotics to cover H. influenzae (Ceftriaxone or equivalent cephalosporins). Ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice for epiglottitis\". Other antibotic options are :- Ampicillin plus sulbactam Cefuroxime Clindamycin Chloramphenicol Cefotaxime Intravenous antibiotics should be continued for 2-3 days, followed by oral antibiotics to complete a 10 days course.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nDepressed bridge of the nose may be due to any of the following except:\n* Leprosy\n* Syphilis\n* Septal abscess (Correct Answer)\n* Acromegaly\n\nExplanation: (d) Acromegaly(Ref.

This high position allows the epiglottis to meet soft palate and make a nasopharyngeal channel for nasal breathing during suckling. The milk feed passes separately over the dorsum of tongue and the sides of epiglottis, thus allowing breathing and feeding to go on simultaneously. Ref:- Dhingra; pg num:-285\n\n## Question from ENT:\nUndifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharynx belongs to which category as per WHO classification\n* Type 1\n* Type 2 (Correct Answer)\n* Type 3\n* Type 4\n\nExplanation: NASOPHARYNGEAL CANCER On the basis of histology, as seen on light microscopy, WHO has lately reclassified epithelial growths into three types:- Ref:- Dhingra; pg num:-250\n\n## Question from ENT:\nTreatment of choice for CSOM with vertigo and facial nerve palsy is:\n* Antibiotics and labyrinthine sedatives\n* Myringoplasty (Correct Answer)\n* Immediate mastoid exploration\n* Labyrinthectomy\n\nExplanation: (c) Immediate mastoid exploration(Ref. Shambaugh, 6th ed., 448)This is an unsafe CSOM. Here cholesteatoma eroding fallopian canal and causing fistula formation on the medial wall of middle ear (lateral semicircular canal, promontory, oval window) is causing facial nerve palsy and vertigo respectively. So the management is immediate mastoid exploration to remove cholesteatoma.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nThe ideal time for Quinsy surgery after acute tonsillitis is\n* 2 weeks\n* 4 weeks (Correct Answer)\n* 6 weeks\n* 12 weeks\n\nExplanation: Tonsillectomy is usually advised 6 weeks after the quinsy attack (Interval tonsillectomy)Hot tonsillectomy- Tonsillectomy during the active abscess stageIn Quinsy, pus collects lateral to the capsule of the tonsil, in the peritonsillar space containing loose areolar tissueRef: Hazarika; 3rd ed; Pg 487\n\n## Question from ENT:\nFibrocailage is present in all, EXCEPT:\n* Pinna (Correct Answer)\n* Symphysis pubis\n* Interveebral disc\n* Menisci of knee joint\n\nExplanation: Fibrocailage is a white opaque structure due to dense collage fibres (type I and II). When a fibrous tissue is subjected to pressure it is replaced by fibrocailage. It is seen in joints, symphysis, interveebral discs, menisci and labra (shoulder joint and hip joint). Pinna is a type of elastic cailage. Elastic cailages are seen at sites concerned with production or reception of sounds eg external acoustic meatus (lateral pa), auditory tube and epiglottis.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nSensory supply of vocal cords is\n* Internal laryngeal nerve\n* Recurrent laryngeal nerve\n* Superior laryngeal nerve (Correct Answer)\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: Above the vocal cords, the larynx is supplied by internal laryngeal nerve--a branch of superior laryngeal, and below the vocal cords by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S.aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body.Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externao Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)o Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency )o ChemotherapyClinical features of malignant otitis externao Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head.o Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part,o Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent.o Fevero Itching of ear or ear canalo Troubled swallowing & weakness of face.Complicationso Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal),o Jugular venous thrombosiso Cavernous sinus thrombosiso MeningitisTreatment of malignant otitis externao In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonalpenicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e.g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used.

What is the most probable diagnosis?\n* CSOM\n* Meningitis (Correct Answer)\n* Lateral sinus thrombosis\n* Petrositis\n\nExplanation: Presence of fever and diplopia in a patient with ear discharge suggests lateral sinus thrombosis, an intracranial complication of chronic suppurative ottitis media.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nPositive Romberg test with eyes closed detects defect in:\n* Proprioceptive pathway (Correct Answer)\n* Cerebellum\n* Spinothalmic tract\n* Peripheral nerve\n\nExplanation: Romberg Test: The patient is asked to stand with the feet closely approximated, first with his/her eyes open, and then closed. The test is 'positive' when the patient is able to stand with his/her feet together while his/her eyes are open, but sways or falls when they are closed. Any lesion along the proprioceptive pathway can result in a positive Romberg test. Proprioceptive pathway: Proprioception is the ability to sense the position of one's extremities without the aid of vision. The peripheral sense organs are located in the muscle, tendons, and joints. The first cell body is situated in the dorsal root ganglion, going without a synapse to the ipsilateral fasiculi cuneatus and gracilis (dorsal column) to the lower medulla where the synapse occurs. Following a decussation of the internal arcuate fibers, the impulses ascend in the medial lemniscus to the thalmus, terminating in the parietal lobe, posterior to those that convey touch.

A: Maxillary Malignant neoplasm most frequently involves the maxillary sinus followed in turn by ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid Paranasal sinuses They are a group of four paired air-filled spaces that surround the nasal cavity The sinuses are named for the facial bones behind which they are located. The maxillary sinuses, also called the maxillary antrechea and the largest of the paranasal sinuses lie in the maxillary bones. The frontal sinuses in the frontal bone The ethmoid sinuses are formed from several discrete air cells within the ethmoid bone. The sphenoid sinuses, in the sphenoid bone at the center of the skull base under the pituitary gland. The paranasal air sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium (ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium). Paranasal sinuses form developmentally through excavation of bone by air-filled sacs (pneumatic diveicula) from the nasal cavity. This process begins prenatally, and it continues through the course of an organism's lifetime Role Decreasing the relative weight of the front of the skull, and especially the bones of the face. Increasing resonance of the voice. Providing a buffer against blows to the face. Insulating sensitive structures like dental roots and eyes from rapid temperature fluctuations in the nasal cavity. Humidifying and heating of inhaled air because of slow air turnover in this region Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses They comprise approximately 0.2% of all malignancies. About 80% of these malignancies arise in the maxillary sinus. Men are much more often affected than women. They most often occur in the age group between 40 and 70 years. Carcinomas are more frequent than sarcomas. Metastases are rare. Tumours of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nWhich of the following laryngeal cailage is Elastic fibrocailage\n* Thyroid\n* Cricoid (Correct Answer)\n* Epiglottis\n* Arytenoids except the tip\n\nExplanation: Thyroid, cricoid and most of the arytenoid cailages are hyaline cailages whereas epiglottis, corniculate, cuneiform and tip of arytenoid near the corniculate cailage are elastic fibrocailage.

CSF, rhinorrhea indicates a basal tear of dura mater along with a fracture involving the paranasal sinuses, frontal, ethmoid, or sphenoid bone. Cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone separates the anterior cranial fossa from the nasal cavity and is the most common site of fracture in CSF rhinorrhea because it is extremely thin. The cerebrospinal fluid has high glucose content, makes a dry hanky stiff, and if mixed with blood it classically produces a halo effect on the white bedclothes. Patients of CSF rhinorrhea are at increased risk of meningitis paicularly pneumococcal. The patient should be given prophylactic antibiotic (penicillin) followed by X-ray. Fractures of the middle 1/3rd of the face should be reduced and most of the times CSF rhinorrhea stops. Indications for anterior fossa explorations are the persistence of CSF rhinorrhea for> 10 days; the presence of a fracture involving the frontal or ethmoidal sinus; aerocele; an attack of meningitis that has been treated.

This muscle arises from aponeurosis of levator palpebrae superior is and inserts in the upper border of tarsal plate. Its function is to raise the lid.Anhidrosis is due to interruption of secretomotor to sweat glands.Sympathetic fibres normally dilate the pupil and their interruption would cause constriction of pupil (not dilatation).\n\n## Question from ENT:\nWhich of the following is false regarding scleroma of larynx?\n* It is an acute inflammatory condition (Correct Answer)\n* It is caused by Klebsiella\n* Subglottic stenosis is a common complication\n* Treatment may include steroids\n\nExplanation: It is a chronic inflammatory condition of the larynx caused by klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and treatment is with streptomycin or tetracycline often combined with steroids to prevent fibrosis.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nAll are implicated in etiology of atrophic rhinitis except:\n* Chronic sinusitis\n* Nasal deformity (Correct Answer)\n* DNS\n* Strong hereditary factors\n\nExplanation: Ans. is c i.e. DNS\n\n## Question from ENT:\nCadaveric position of vocal cords ?\n* Midline\n* 1.5 mm from midline (Correct Answer)\n* 3.5 mm from midline\n* 7.5 mm from midline\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., 3.5 mm from midline Position of vocal cords The position of the vocal cords may be described as being in various positions. These are : ? 1. Median position The vocal cords are in midline. This is the position of normal larynx during phonation and in recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. 2. Paramedian position Just off midline (1.5 mm form midline) This position occurs in normal larynx during strong whisper. This is the resting position of vocal cords after long-term recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. 3. Cadeveric (Intermediate) position (3.5 mm from midline) It is 15-20deg from midline. This is the position of immediate total denervation of both recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as superior laryngeal paralysis, as in high vagal paralysis. 4. Gentle abduction (7 mm from midline) This position is seen during quiet respiration in normal larynx and in paralysis of adductors (very rare). 5. Abduct position (9.5 mm from midline) It is 30-45deg from midline. This is the position of maximum adduction during deep inspiration.\n\n## Question from ENT:\nSensorineural deafness in neonates is best diagnosed by:\n* BERA (Correct Answer)\n* OAE\n* Tympanometry\n* Electrocochleography\n\nExplanation: Ans. (a) BERA Ref: Dhingra's ENT 5th ed. / 31-32 Screening with OAE, Final confirmation with BERA. * Otoaoustic emission are low intensity sounds produced by outer hair cells of normal cochlea. This sound travels in a reverse direction from outer hair cells to external auditory canal via middle ear. It is used as a screening test of hearing in neonates and uncooperative and mentally challenged individuals. * OAE is considered as best test for screening of hearing in neonates * BERA is brainstem evoked response audiometry.

Clinically, patient presents with hoarseness or husky voice and irritation in the throat. Indirect laryngoscopy reveals heaping up of red or grey granulation tissue in the interarytenoid region and posterior thirds of vocal cords; the latter sometimes showing ulceration due to constant hammering of vocal processes as in talking, forming what is called \"contact ulcer.\" The condition is bilateral and symmetrical. It does not undergo malignant change. However, biopsy of the lesion is essential to differentiate the lesionfrom carcinoma and tuberculosis. Aetiology is unceain. It is mostly seen in men who indulge in excessive alcohol and smoking. Other factors are excessive forceful talking and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease where posterior pa of larynx is being constantly bathed with acid juices from the stomach. Treatment is removal of granulation tissue under operating microscope which may require repetition, control of acid reflux and speech therapy.

Explosion injury An explosion is a phenomenon resulting from sudden release of energy which is then dissipated by a blast wave, by translocation of objects, or by the generation of heat. Injuries in explosion occur due to four factors :? 1) Blast or shock wave When an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviornment in which blast occurs :- Air blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other pas injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected. Under water blast (explosion under water): Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured. Solid blast : Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and veebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung. 2) Flame or hot gases Burns or burning of body may occur. 3) Flying missiles (debris) Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations. 4) Anoxia Various gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO,.\n\n## Question from Forensic Medicine:\nLeast toxic compound of lead is -\n* Lead acetate\n* Lead oxide\n* Lead carbonate (Correct Answer)\n* Lead sulphide\n\nExplanation: Lead sulphide is the least toxic salt of lead.\n\n## Question from Forensic Medicine:\nGunshot residue on hands can he detected by which test-\n* Benzidine test\n* Phenolphthalein test (Correct Answer)\n* Dermal nitrate test\n* Hydrogen activation analysis\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Dermal nitrate test o Dermal nitrate/ paraffin/diphenylamine test:It is used to detect firearm residues on the hands of the suspectIn this, the hands are coated with a layer of liquid paraffin. After cooling, the casts are removed & treated with an acid solution of diphenvlamine, a reagent used to detect nitrates & nitrites that originate from gunpowder & is deposited on the skin of the person who has fired the shot.A positive test is indicated by the presence of blue flakes in the paraffin.o Benzidine test- most sensitive test for detection of blood,o Phenolphthalein / Kastle Mayer test-screening test for blood stainso Harrison & Gilroy test hydrogen activation analysis- is used to detect heavy metal.

Phenol\n\n## Question from Forensic Medicine:\nTentative cuts are seen in: September 2011\n* Homicidal death (Correct Answer)\n* Suicidal death\n* Accidental death\n* Hanging\n\nExplanation: Ans. B: Suicidal deaths Hesitation cuts derive their name from the hesitation with which these incisions are inflicted by a person intending to commit suicide by a cutting instrument. The preliminary cuts are known as tentative cuts Hesitation cuts are not found in homicidal assaults Hesitation/ tentative wounds They are defined either as: any cut or wound that is self-inflicted after a decision is made not to commit suicide, or any tentative cut or wound that is made before the final cut that causes death. Such wounds are usually superficial, sharp, forced skin cuts found on the body of victims. These less severe cutting marks are often caused by attempts to build up courage before attempting the final, fatal wound. Non-fatal, shallow hesitation wounds can also accompany the deeper, sometimes fatal incisions. Although hesitation cuts are not always present in cases of suicide, they are typical of suicidal injuries. However, the presence of hesitation marks alongside or near to the final fatal mark usually indicates a forensic diagnosis of suicide over other possible causes of death. Hesitation wounds are generally straight-line marks at the elbows, neck/throat, and wrists, although in a few cases they occur in the general area of the upper middle pa of the abdomen (near the hea). Wounds made by people attempting suicide are typically made at an angle related to the hand that holds the weapon. The angle of such hesitation wounds is usually in a downward flowing direction because of the natural motion of the arm as it sweeps across the body. Hesitation wounds are often made under clothing, with paicular pas of the clothing being paed to expose the target area of the body. Instruments used to inflict hesitation wounds are generally those found around the living quaers of the person attempting suicide. Such instruments include kitchen knives, single-edge and double-edge knifes, pocket knives, hatchets, razor blades, screwdrivers, and other sharp objects. People who have previously attempted suicide, but have not succeeded in their endeavor, will often carry visible scars from hesitation wounds.\n\n## Question from Forensic Medicine:\nThe poison that can be detected in hair long after death is -\n* Lead\n* Mercury (Correct Answer)\n* Arsenic\n* Cannabis\n\nExplanation: Arsenic poisoning can be detected from hair and nails long after death.\n\n## Question from Forensic Medicine:\nSexual gratification obtained by wearing dresses of opposite sides in\n* Necrophilia\n* Fetichism\n* Frotteurism (Correct Answer)\n* Transvestism\n\nExplanation: TRANSVESTISM In this type of sexual perversion, sexual satisfaction is obtained by wearing clothes of the opposite sex.

Because of the cooling of the liquid due to evaporation, the lesion due to scald is not very deep. However the latent heat of the viscid fluid is high and hence, the penetration capacity of heat of such liquids is more. Thus an injury caused by hot tar, syrup, oil, etc is comparatively deeper than that caused by hot water.

These clauses are not mutually exclusive for there can be injuries which may fall in more than one clause. However, the list is exhaustive in the sense that, the framers of the Code have used the term \"only\", while listing the type of hus which they designated as \"grievous\". This positively shows that the list is exhaustive and no hu outside the list given in S. 320 can be termed as 'grievous hu'. The following kinds of hu only are designated as \"grievous\" Emasculation. Permanent privation of the sight of either eye. Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear Privation of any member or joint. Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint. Permanent disfiguration of the head or face. Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth. Any hu which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of twenty days in severe bodily pain or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. Where injury was caused on the abdomen with a sharp edged weapon and the doctor had stated that the injury had penetrated the abdominal cavity but had not involved any vital organs/ impoant structures, but had just touched the stomach, it was held that the accused had caused only simple hu. Similarly, cutting of a tendon or a muscle does not make the injury fall under purview of any clauses of S 320 IPC.

Whats the best management now?\n* Frusemide to reduce the swelling\n* Do urgent venous Doppler studies done to rule out deep vein thromboses\n* Admit the patient & rule out preeclampsia (Correct Answer)\n* This is a normal finding of pregnancy, and no treatment is needed\n\nExplanation: During pregnancy, there is a decrease in colloid osmotic pressure and a fall in plasma osmolality. There is an increase in venous pressure created by paial occlusion of the vena cava by the gravid uterus, which also contributes to pedal edema. Salt restriction won't help in the physiological edema Doppler studies of the lower extremities are not indicated in this patient since the history and examination, the lack of calf tenderness etc are all consistent with physiologic edema.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nCharacteristic feature of carcinoma fallopian tube :\n* Watery discharge P/N (Correct Answer)\n* Hemorrhage\n* Pain\n* Sepsis\n\nExplanation: Ans. is a i.e. Watery discharge PN Fallopian Tube Carcinoma accounts for 0.3% of all cancers of female genital tract. *Most common site is the ampulla of the tube Most common type is adenocarcinoma. The fallopian tube is frequently involved in secondary to carcinoma of ovary, endometrium, gastrointestinal tract, breast and peritoneum. Women with mutation in BRCA I and BRCA II have higher risk of developing fallopian tube carcinoma (therefore, a prophylactic surgery in these women should include a complete removal of both tubes along with the ovaries). Most common symptom is Vaginal discharge Went watery vaginal discharge called as Hvdrop, Later due to ulceration - watery discharge becomes blood stained and may take the form of perimenopausal/ postmenopausal bleeding. Always remember : In perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with unusual, unexplained or persistent vaginal discharge, even in absence of bleeding, the clinician should always keep the possibility of occult tubal cancer in mind. Triad of : - Vaginal discharge 1 - Pelvic pain } is seen in 15% of patients - Pelvic mass 1 On examination : pelvic mass may be felt. Spread : Since the fallopian tube is richly supplied by lymphatics, spread to the pelvic and para - aoic nodes occurs early.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nA lady approaches a physician for contraceptive advice.

Ovulatory (20%)\nAnovulatory (80%):   • Threshold bleeding of puberty menorrhagia\n                                     • Metropathia hemorrhagica/ cystic glandular hyperplasia\n                                     • Premenopausal DUB (Atrophy of endometrium).\nOvulatory (20%):       • Irregular ripening of corpus luteum\n                                     • Irregular shedding of corpus luteum\n                                     • IUCD insertion\n                                     • Following sterilization operation.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nWhich of the following is seen during pregnancy?\n* Respiratory alkalosis (Correct Answer)\n* Respiratory acidosis\n* Metabolic alkalosis\n* Metabolic acidosis\n\nExplanation: Respiratory alkalosis REF: Dutta 6th ed p. 55 Pregnancy is a state of respiratory alkalosis, hyperventillation is seen in it.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nTumour marker of endodermal sinus tumour of ovary :\n* a feto proteins (Correct Answer)\n* CA 125\n* HCG\n* CEA\n\nExplanation: a feto proteins\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nWhich of the following anti-hypertensive is contraindicated in pregnancy:\n* Beta blockers (Correct Answer)\n* ACE inhibitors\n* Methyldopa\n* Ca channel blockers\n\nExplanation: Ans. (b) ACE inhibitorsRef KDT 6th ed. 553; Williams 24th ed, /: 1025* ACEs are the drugs which inhibit the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. They can cause severe fetal malformations when given in the second and third trimesters.* These include: Hypocalvaria and renal dysfunction and are also teratogenic and because of this, they are not recommended during pregnancy* Angiotensin-receptor blockers act in a similar manner.But, instead of blocking the production of angiotensin- II, they inhibit binding to its receptor. They are presumed to have the same fetal effects as ACE inhibitors and thus are also contraindicated.Antihypertensive to be avoided during pregnancyAntihypertensive safer during pregnancy* ACE inhibitors (Ex- captopril, enelapril etc.)* Angiotensin antagonist (losartan, telmesartan)* Thiazide diuretics (Ex- hydrochlorthiazide)* Furosemide* Propanolol* Nitroprusside* Hydralazine* Methyldopa* Atenolol* Metoprolol* Labetalol-DOC* Nifedipine* Prazosin and ClonidineDrugs and their respective risk* Diuretics: tend to reduce blood volume; increase risk of placental infarcts, fetal wastage, stillbirth.* ACE inhibitors, ATI antagonists: growth retardation and fetal damage risk.* Propanolol: causes low birth weight, neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia.* Nitroprusside: contraindicated in eclampsia.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nWhich of the following has life span of upto 10 years?\n* Progestasert (Correct Answer)\n* CuT 380A\n* LNG-IUD\n* CuT 250\n\nExplanation: Ans. B. CuT 380A. (Ref. Obstetrics D.C. Dutta 6th Ed. - 483).The TCu380A IUD (ParaGard) is a T-shaped polyethylene rod, wrapped with copper around the arms and stem. It is approved for 10 years of continuous use.Good Candidates for TCu380A# Postpartum women, breastfeeding or not, after 4 weeks.# Women with liver disease, hepatitis.# Women with breast cancer.# Women with hypertension, hyperlipidemia.# Women with current or history of ischemic heart disease, stroke.# Women with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Women with uncomplicated valvular heart disease.# Women with current deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism.# Women who have had major surgery.# Women with migraines with or without focal neurological symptoms.# Women with gall bladder disease or history of pregnancy-related cholestasis.The LNG-IUS (Mirena). is a T-shaped polydimethylsiloxane rod con- taining 52 mg LNG. The LNG-IUS is approved for 5 years of use. The LNG-IUS adds an important non-contra- ceptive advantage for this age group: it decreases menstrual blood loss and dysmenorrhea and may avoid the need for hysterectomy or endometrial ablation. The copper IUD is generally associated with heavier menses.In addition to decreasing menstrual blood loss, the local administration of LNG to the endometrium protects it from development of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. This is of benefit for transitional women with irregular bleeding and for women on tamoxifen therapy following breast cancer. Use of the LNG-IUS is reported to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer by 40-60%.GOOD CANDIDATES FOR LNG-IUS# Women with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, or endometriosis.# Women with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulation therapy.Women with thalassemia, sickle cell disease, or iron- deficiency anemia.# Breastfeeding women after 4-6 weeks postpartum.Generation of IUCDCoilFailure rateLasts for (years)FirstCuT (200)>2/1003-5 CuT (200)>2/100 SecondMultiload Cu 2501-2 /1003-5 NovaT1-2 /1001-2/100ThirdMultiload Cu 3750.5-111005+ Copper Cu 380A0.3-1/100 Hormone releasingProgestasert (no more manufactured)1lyr LNG-IUCD(52mg Levenorgestrel impregnated; releases at arte of 20?g/day)0.5/100 at 1 yr5 yrs 0.7/100 at 3 yr 1/100 at 5 yr Marina (Latest)Least5 yrsMore Educational points:# Cu T 380A and Levenorgestrel have got lowest rate, whereas progestasert has got highest rate of ectopic pregnancy.# The Mirena IUD works by killing or irreparably damaging sperm and obstructing it's ability to fertilize an egg. It does this by releasing levonorgestrel, also known as progestin.# Progestin is a synthetic substance which imitates the biological activity of the natural hormone progesterone.# Progesterone can inhibit ovulation during pregnancy. Progestin was synthesized for, among reasons, suppresing ovulation for birth control.- Mirena reduces the frequency of ovulation. Ovulation occurs during the menstrual cycle where the ovarian follicle releases an egg. Reduction of the times in which an egg is available to fertilize handicaps the sperm's opportunity for reproduction.- Mirena changes the consistency of cervical mucus. This change thickens the cervical mucus making the passage of sperm through the cervix much more difficult.- Mirena thins the endometrium, the lining of the walls of the uterus. It is thought that this reduces the chances of embryo implantation to the endometrium.LNG-IUCD:# A new device, levonova (LNG IUD) contains 60mg of levonorgestrel and releases the hormone in very low doses i.e. 20 microgram/ day (versus Progestasert which carries 38mg of progesterone and releases 65microgram of the hormone per day).# It is thus longacting (5 years) and has low pregnancy rate of 0-3 per 100 woman years, n However, risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher.# Mechanism of action: - Strong and uniform endometrial suppression - Scanty cervical mucus - Anovulation and insufficient luteal phase and normal progesterone levels, n It can be used as hormone replacing therapy.# It is useful for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia, n Irregular uterine bleeding can be a problem initially.# MIRENA contains 52mg levonorgestrel, eluting 20 microgram daily. It can be retained for 5 years, with failure rate of 0 to 3 per 100 woman years.EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION (Postcoital contraception)Mechanism of action1. Delaying /inhibiting ovulation2.

(C) Male infertility(Ref: Goodman Gilman 13th E/P781)GnRH agonists can be used by pulsatile and non-pulsatile or continuous dosing.By pulsatile dosing they increase release of LH/FSH and cause ovulation, spermatogenesis and increase synthesis estrogen and testosterone. Hence used for treatment of anovulation, oligospermia (male infertility), delayed puberty and sexual infantilism.By continuous dosing, they decrease synthesis of estrogen and testosterone. Hence used for treatment of estrogen and testosterone dependent conditions like ER positive breast cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids and prostate cancer.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nMost impoant suppo of uterus for preventing prolapse is:\n* Pelvic floor (Correct Answer)\n* Round ligament of ovary\n* Round ligament of uterus\n* Transverse cervical ligament\n\nExplanation: Pelvic diaphragm is the most impoant suppo for the uterus. It comprises of levator ani muscle: ischio-coccygeus, ilio-coccygeus and pubo-coccygeus (most impoant) coccygeus superior and inferior fascia Prolapse of uterus occurs usually in old age in a multiparous woman. A neglected or imperfectly repaired perineal tear is an impoant cause of such a prolapse. It is also ored by hard manual or domestic labor, subinvolution of uterus, injury or idiopathic weakness of transverse cervical and uterosacral ligaments and a persistent rise in intra-abdominal pressure.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nAbnormal Fetal tachycardia is defined as:\n* Fetal hea rate >= 160 bpm (Correct Answer)\n* Fetal hea rate >= 180 bpm\n* Fetal hea rate >= 200 bpm\n* None of the above\n\nExplanation: Fetal hea rate above 180bpm is considered as abnormal tachycardia.

It is only functional closure of these, that results from expansion of lungs at bih and lowering of resistance of pulmonary vasculature that results in change of blood flow pattern through hea from parallel to series like that in adults. Shunt/ vessel Functional closure Anatomical closure Remnant called as Ductus venosus 10-96 hrs after bih 2-3 weeks after bih Ligamentum venosum Ductus aeriosus At bih Several weeks after bih Ligamentum aeriosum Foramen ovale At bih 1 year after bih Fossa ovalis Umbilical vein Ligamentum teres Distal hypogastric aeries Umbilical ligaments\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nUnsatisfactory colposcopy means :\n* Failure to visualize cervix (Correct Answer)\n* Failure to visualize transformation zone\n* Failure to visualize squamous epithelium\n* Failure to visualize columnar epithelium\n\nExplanation: Ans. is b i.e. Failure to visualize transformation zone Colposcopy is the primary technique for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology smear. Whole of the transformation zone needs to be visualised, as this area is believed to be the site of neoplastic change. Colposcopy is deemed unsatisfactory if the whole of the transformation zone is not visualised. This situation may arise in postmenopausal women, and the clinician may reso to a sho course of oral oestrogens; and when colposcopy is repeated 6 -- 8 weeks later, the squamocolumnar junction will often be visible. Unsatisfactory colposcopy in the presence of abnormal cytology is an indication for a cone biopsy.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nInformation obtained by lateral plate X-ray pelvimetry are all except:\n* Sacral curve\n* True conjugate (Correct Answer)\n* Bispinous diameter\n* Inclination of the pelvis\n\nExplanation: Bispinous diameter can be measured by anteroposterior view and not on lateral view of X-ray pelvimetry.\nX-ray pelvimetry is of limited value in the diagnosis of pelvic contraction or cephalopelvic disproportion. Apart from pelvic capacity there are several other factors involved in successful vaginal delivery. These are the fetal size, presentation, position and the force of uterine contractions. X-ray pelvimetry cannot assess the other factors. It cannot reliably predict the likelihood of vaginal delivery neither in breech presentation nor in cases with previous cesarean section.\n\nX-ray pelvimetry is useful in cases with fractured pelvis and for the important diameters which are inaccessible to clinical examination.\nTechniques: For complete evaluation of the pelvis, three views are taken — anteroposterior, lateral and outlet. But commonly, X-ray pelvimetry is restricted to only the erect lateral view (the femoral head and acetabular margins must be superimposed) which gives most of the useful information. Anteroposterior view can give the accurate measurement of the transverse diameter of the inlet and bispinous diameter.\nHazards of X-ray pelvimetry includes radiation exposure to the mother and the fetus. With conventional X-ray pelvimetry radiation exposure to the gonads is about 885 millirad.

It involves rupturing the membranes overlying the cervix using a Kocher's forcepdeg. It is applicable when cervix is paially dilated and bishiop score is high Contraindications Intrauterine fetal deathdeg * Maternal AIDS Genital active herpes infection * Chronic hydramniosdeg (In chronic hydrominos controlled ARM is done and not just simple ARM -- as sudden decompression can lead to abruptio placentae) Advantaper Promotes labour by stimulating release of endogenous prostaglandins. Encourages application of the fetal head to the cervix. Colour of the liquor can be observed and meconium staining ruled out. Permits the use of fetal scalp electrode for intrapaum fetal surveillance. Disadvantages : If performed before the presenting pa is well fixed, so it can lead to cord prolapse. ARM can lead to-infection if frequent vaginal examinations are performed. It can cause abruption in case of polyhydramnios. Also Know Stripping of Membranes is the digital separation of membranes from the wall of the cervix and lower uterine segment. Immediately after ARM fetal hea sounds should be auscultated. Transient changes in the fetal hea rate, can occur due to resettlement of the cord after the liquor flows out. Early and variable decelerationdeg of fetal hea rate is relatively common with amniotomy.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nVertical transmission of HIV is most likely to occur\n* Early antepartum\n* Late antepartum (Correct Answer)\n* Intrapartum\n* Postpartum\n\nExplanation: Most of the vertical transmission of HIV is likely to occur during labor.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nThe following complication is seen in\n* Diabetes complicating pregnancy (Correct Answer)\n* Hypeension complicating pregnancy\n* Placenta pre complicating pregnancy\n* Preterm delivery\n\nExplanation: Couvelaire Uterus: Seen in cases of placental abruption.

They can be accopanied by:Heart palpitations; Sleep disturbances; Profuse perspiration; Cold chills; Anxiety; FlushingHot flashes are: Mainly women over 40 as they transition into menopause as well as pregnant women.Other causes of Hot Flushes:Thyroid disease, epilepsy, autoimmune disorders, insulinomas, pancreatic tumors, leukemias.Hot flushes are waves of vasodilation affecting face & neck last for 2-5 min each more severe during night, disturb sleep.Mechanism:Estrogen deficiency - Reduces hypothalamine endorphine - Release more norepinephrine & serotonin - Leads to inappropriate heat loss mechanism.Hormonal Replacement Therapy:Benefit of HRT for Relief of Symptoms:Hot flashes: Highly effective; Usually required for a relatively short period of time, E.g., 1 to 3 years.Mood disturbance: Improve irritability & anxiety in many menopausal women; Relieve mild depressive symptoms.Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is indicated in menopausal women to overcome the short-term and long-term consequences of estrogen deficiency. HRT can be administered orally (in pill form), vaginally (as a cream) or trans dermally (in patch form) because it replaces female hormones produced by the ovaries, hormone replacement therapy minimize menopause symptoms. Used before, during & after menopause.Who needs HRT:Symptomatic women who suffer from estrogen deficiency (Therapeutic); High risk cases for menopausal complications such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, colonic cancer (prophylactic)Premature & surgical menopause; Gonadal dysgenesis in adolescents.Treatment of Hot Flashes: If mild symptoms & signs advised exercise.Initiate low dose HRT if:Moderate or severe symptoms: Non-hormonal treatments have failed; No interest in non-hormonal therapyTitrate estrogen dosage upward if needed.When estrogen can't be used, offer:SSRI or SNRI; Gabapentin, clonidine, alpha-methyldopa; MPA or MegesterolAttempt discontinuation after 1-2 yearsTREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS SHOWN TO HAVE CLINICAL BENEFITSSymptomsHormone TherapyNon-hormonal TreatmentsLifestyle ChangeVasomotorOral conjugated estrogens and MPAParoxetineSmoking cessationContinuous and sequentialVenlafaxineDecrease alcohol consumptionOral estradiol and norgestimatelGabapentinRelaxation techniquesTransdermal*. 17 beta estradiol-norethindrone acetate*. 17 beta estradiol - levonogestre*. 17 beta estradiol*.

Following the LH surge, the corpus luteum is programmed to secrete progesterone for 10-12 days. Without fuher LH stimulation and in the absence of pregnancy, both major cell types of the corpus luteum cease steroid production and undergo apoptosis while the tissue regresses. The corpus luteum that persists for pa of only one menstrual cycle is called a corpus luteum of menstruation.

Williams 23/e, p 819, Fernando Arias 3/e, p 197, 198The fluid in vagina is amniotic fluid, as it showed in fern pattern on microscopy (presence of sodium chloride in liquor) and the red litmus turned blue (vaginal pH is acidic; amniotic fluid is alkaline).This patient with premature rupture of membranes (PROM) has a physical examination consistent with an intrauterine infection or chorioamnionitis.Acute Chorioamniotis is diagnosed clinically in presence of fever (100.4degF or 37.8degC) and at least two of the following:a. Maternal tachycardiab. Fetal tachycardiac. Uterine tendernessd. Foul smelling amniotic fluide. Maternal leukocytosisWhen chorioamnionitis is diagnosed, fetal and maternal morbidities increase and delivery is indicated regardless of the fetus's gestational age. In the case described, labor should be induced and antibiotics to be given to avoid neonatal group of streptococcal infection. Ampicillin is the drug of choice.There is no role for tocolysis in the setting of chorioamnionitis and also because gestational age of patient is 35 weeks, since delivery is the goal: There is also no role for the administration of steroids as it is contraindicated in case of chorioamnionitis.Remember: Management of chorioamnionitis at any age is delivery, regardless of the gestational age.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nThe current imaging technique of choice for the diagnosis of hydatidiform mole is :\n* Computed tomography (Correct Answer)\n* Ultrasonography\n* Plain X-ray abdomen\n* Magneic resonance imaging\n\nExplanation: Ultrasonography\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nHormone replacement therapy is not given for:(AIIMS May 2013, Nov 2011)\n* Urogenital atrophy\n* Vasomotor symptoms\n* Prevention of osteoporosis (Correct Answer)\n* Prevention of CAD\n\nExplanation: Ans. d. Prevention of CAD (Ref: Novak's Gynae 14/e p1330-1333)Normal women have ovarian failure or menopause, at a mean age of 51 years, with 95 percent becoming menopausal between the ages of 45 to 55 years.Estrogen is the most effective treatment available for relief of the menopausal symptoms that many women experience, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, urinary symptoms, and emotional lability.However, data from the Women's Health Initiative showed no cardiovascular benefit with unopposed estrogen and a small increase in risk with combined therapy.Estrogen is an option for the prevention of osteoporosis in perimenopausal women, estrogen-progesterone therapy reduces fracture risk at a cost of increase in the incidence of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and venous thromboembolism, or in the case unopposed estrogen, an increase in stroke and thromboembolism.At this time, post-menopausal hormone therapy, either unopposed estrogen or combined estrogen-progestin therapy should not be initiated for prevention of CUD.Hormone Replacement TherapyEstrogen is the most effective treatment available for relief of the menopausal symptoms that many women experience, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, urinary symptoms, and emotional lability.However, data from the Women's Health Initiative showed no cardiovascular benefit with unopposed estrogen and a small increase in risk with combined therapy.Estrogen is an option for the prevention of osteoporosis in perimenopausal women, estrogen-progesterone therapy reduces fracture risk at a cost of increase in the incidence of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and venous thromboembolism, or in the case unopposed estrogen, an increase in stroke and thromboembolism.At this time, pwst-menopausal hormone therapy, either unopposed estrogen or combined estrogen-progestin therapy should not be initiated for prevention of CHD.In addition, postmenopausal hormone therapy is no longer considered to be first line drug for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.Bisphosphonates or raloxifene are recommended as first line drugs for prevention and bisphosphonates for treatment of established osteoporosis.\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nUSG abdomen of a 30-year-old SLE patient who cannot feel her baby moving for past 7 days.

Page 993 by Dean Hess, Neil MacIntyre, Shelley MishoeMost standard text books of pediatrics and respiratory medicine describe apnea of prematurity as cessation of respiration > 20 secs along wTith bradycardia, hypoxia , cyanosis or pallor.Apnea is traditionally classified as either obstructive, central, or mixed. Obstructive apnea may occur when the infant s neck is hyperflexed or conversely, hyperextended. It may also occur due to low pharyngeal muscle tone or to inflammation of the soft tissues, which can block the flow of air though the pharynx and vocal cords. Central apnea occurs when there is a lack of respiratory effort. This may result from central nervous system immaturity, or from the effects of medications or illness. Many episodes of apnea of prematurity may start as either obstructive or central, but then involve elements of both, becoming mixed in nature\n\n## Question from Gynaecology & Obstetrics:\nThe following is always an indication of cesarean section, except:\n* Abruption Placentae (Correct Answer)\n* Untreated stage of Ib Ca cervix\n* Active primary genital herpes\n* Type IV Placenta Previa\n\nExplanation: Cesarean Section is not indicated in all cases of abruptio placentae.\n\n“An attempt at vaginal delivery is indicated if the degree of separation appears to be limited and if continuous FHR tracing is reassuring.

Predisposing conditions include acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease and adrenocoical insufficiency. The condition is generally precipitated in patients at risk from an increased intake of magnesium, or from the use of magnesium-containing medications, such as antacids, laxatives and enemas. Clinical features include bradycardia, hypotension, reduced consciousness and respiratory depression. Disappearance of deep tendon reflexes Management involves ceasing all magnesium-containing drugs and reducing dietary magnesium intake, improving renal function if possible, and promoting urinary magnesium excretion using a loop diuretic with intravenous hydration, if residual renal function allows. Calcium gluconate may be given intravenously to ameliorate cardiac effects. Dialysis may be necessary in patients with poor renal function.

Which of the following lesions would NOT lead to a deficiency of this vitamin?\n* Chronic gastritis resulting in achlorhydria\n* Autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells (Correct Answer)\n* Surgical resection of the jejunum\n* Surgical resection of the ileum\n\nExplanation: Absorption of vitamin B12 requires formation of a complex with intrinsic factor, which is secreted by parietal cells of the stomach. Destruction of these cells thus results in a vitamin B12 deficiency. The vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex is absorbed in the ileum. Thus, surgical resection of the ileum, but not of the jejunum, will also produce a deficiency. Ref: Kaushansky K., Kipps T.J. (2011). Chapter 37.

He consumes high quantities of alcohol regularly. His symptoms staed 4 days ago. But he continued to consume alcohol. He was admitted for fuher evaluation. Presently, he has severe vomiting. He also complains of dizziness when standing. Examination revealed tenderness in the epigastrium and right hypochondrium. A reddish discolouration is noted in the flanks. Which of the following statements regarding the patient is most accurate?\n* The patient should be evaluated for concomitant appendicitis\n* USG is likely to demonstrate pseudocyst of pancreas (Correct Answer)\n* Contrast CT scan of the abdomen will reveal severe necrotising pancreatitis\n* Pancreatic calcification will be seen in X-ray abdomen\n\nExplanation: The history and clinical features (Abdominal tenderness, hypotension due to blood loss, Grey Turner's sign) are suggestive of acute pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis. Hence a contrast CT scan of the abdomen will reveal severe necrotising pancreatitis.Reddish / bluish discolouration of the flanks is known as Grey Turner's sign. It is named after George Grey Turner, a British surgeon. It is seen in cases of acute pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis and intra abdominal bleedinAnother feature of pancreatic necrosis is a bluish discolouration around the umbilicus, known as Cullen's sign. It is named after Thomas Stephen Cullen, a Canadian gynecologist who first described the sign in a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy in 1916. Both these signs take 1-2 days to develop in a case of acute pancreatitiFocal / diffuse enlargement of pancreatic parenchyma Indistinct margins Density changes due to presence of oedema Retroperitoneal stranding Elimination of the other options Pseudocyst of pancreas usually develops a few weeks after the onset of pancreatitis The features are not suggestive of appendicitis Pancreatic calcification is seen in chronic pancreatitis.

Patients at increased risk for bleeding tend to be hypeensive, have atherosclerosis, and regularly use aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Most bleeds are self-limited and stop spontaneously with bowel rest. The lifetime risk of rebleeding is 25%.Reference: Harrison&;s Principles of Internal Medicine; 19th edition; Chapter 353; Diveicular Disease and Common Anorectal Disorder\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nWhich of the following statements about Pseudohypoprathyroidismistrue-\n* Caused by 'Gain of!ftmction' inherited mutation in Gsa subunit\n* Decreased formation of cyclic GMP is observed\n* Decreased formation of Inositol triphosphate is observed (Correct Answer)\n* Decreased formation of c-AMP is observed\n\nExplanation: decreased urinary cyclic AMP responses to PTH , presumably with a post -GS alpha defect in adenyl cyclase stimulation ( Harrison 17 pg 2394)\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nA 41 year old patient presented with chronic diarrhoea for 3 months. A d-xylose absorption test was ordered to look for:\n* Carbohydrate malabsorption due to mucosa] disease (Correct Answer)\n* Carbohydrate malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis\n* Fat malabsorption due to mucosal disease\n* Fat malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis\n\nExplanation: Ans is A (Carbohydrate malabsorption due to mucosal disease) `The urinary D-xylose test for carbohydrate absorption provides an assessment of proximal small intestine mucosal function.' Urinary D-xylose test: Principle D-xylose is a `pentose. that is completely absorbed almost exclusively in the proximal small intestine and excreted subsequently in the urine. The level of excreted D-xylose in urine is estimated. Any decrease in its level in urine means abnormality in carbohydrate absorption in proximal intestine. Procedure & interpretation 25g D-xylose is given and urine is collected for 5 hrs. An excretion of < 4.5e primarily reflects the presence of duodenal /jejuna) mucosal disease.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nTerry's nails are seen in:\n* Renal failure\n* Respiratory failure (Correct Answer)\n* Liver failure\n* Psoriasis\n\nExplanation: Ans.

The pain occurs with initial penetration and continues throughout the entire episode. She relates that she and her husband have been married for a year and previously had a pleasurable, pain- free relationship. She tells you that she has been to several area doctors and had a \"full work-up\" without a diagnosis, including a pelvic examination, Pap smear with cultures, and pelvic sonogram. On examination, she has a normal pelvic examination with no pain. You are unsure of the differential diagnosis, so you continue taking more history. She admits to vaginal dryness and low libido during this same timeframe. You ask if anything in her life changed 2 months ago. She suddenly begins to cry and states she found evidence of her husband's infidelity 2 months ago. What is the most appropriate recommendation for your patient?\n* Marriage counseling (Correct Answer)\n* Estrogen vaginal cream for vaginal dryness\n* Vaginal dilators for treatment of vaginismus\n* Antidepressant therapy\n\nExplanation: An organic cause of this patient's sexual dysfunction is unlikely. Her pain during intercourse, poor desire, and lack of sufficient lubrication probably stem from the psychological stress from her husband's infidelity. Marital counseling may aid in resolving the issues that resulted in the infidelity, and the aftermath. Female sexual dysfunction consists of four broad categories: dyspareunia, orgasmic disorder, arousal disorder, and impaired sexual drive. Sexual dysfunction may result from physical conditions, such as neuropathy or sleep deprivation, or from psychological conditions, such as depression or a history of abuse. A thorough evaluation should include medical conditions as well as psychosocial questions pertaining to the health of her relationship with her partner and personal issues that contribute to her sexual well-being. Topical intravaginal estrogens are useful for perimenopausal vaginal dryness, and vaginal dilators are often tried for vaginismus, but neither would help her obvious psychological distress. Antidepressants would not address the cause of her symptoms. Low-dose testosterone has not been approved for the management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder and would not address the cause of this woman's distress.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nThe following is the least likely manifestation of acute Budd-Chiari syndrome:\n* Enlarged tender liver\n* Ascites\n* Jaundice (Correct Answer)\n* Venous collaterals\n\nExplanation: Venous collaterals are formed in poal hypeension and require time to be formed and hence are unlikely to be seen in acute Budd Chiari syndrome C/F of B.C.S-1.

Most common cause of hepatic vein obstruction causing budd chiari syndrome is thrombosis of hepatic vein 8.Obstruction of two or more major hepatic vein produce budd chiari syndrome 9.Obstruction of a single main hepatic vein by thrombosis is clinicaly silent.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nTrue about hepatorenal syndrome-\n* Seen in advanced stage of cirrhosis\n* Type II more serious prognosis than type I (Correct Answer)\n* Due to intense hypoperfusion of kidney\n* Renal insult is the primary injury\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nEB Virus is associated with which carcinoma:\n* Carcinoma of larynx\n* Carcinoma of bladder (Correct Answer)\n* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma\n* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nWhich of the following is not a feature of cluster headache ?\n* Headache is predominantly unilateral (Correct Answer)\n* Affects predominantly females\n* Onset typically occur in 20-50 years of life\n* Associated with conjunctival congestion\n\nExplanation: Cluster headache occur three times more common in men than in women. Cluster headache is likely a disorder involving central pacemaker neurons in the region of the posterior hypothalamus. It is associated with symptoms such as conjunctival injection or lacrimation, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, or cranial sympathetic dysfunction such as ptosis. These defects occur due to parasympathetic activation which occur as a result of injury to ascending sympathetic fibers surrounding a dilated carotid aery as it passes into the cranial cavity. Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Chapter 14\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nNot seen with uremic lung\n* alveolar injury\n* Pulmonary edema (Correct Answer)\n* Interstitial fibrosis\n* Fibrinous exudate in alveoli\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Interstitial fibrosis Uremic lung is referred to abnormalities expressed chest x-ray abnormalities seen in patients with CKD. The pathogenesis was believed to be related to blood urea nitrogen and creatinine retention. There is : Its pathophysiology is based on uremia-induced increased permeability of pulmonary alveolo-capillary interfaces, leading to Interstitial and intra-alveolar edema Atelectasis Alveolar hemorrhage Pulmonary hyaline membrane formation. These changes are compounded by bleeding diathesis secondary to platelet dysfunction in advanced renal disease. The pulmonary symptoms and radiographic findings are reversible with hemodialysis.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nCardiac defect in William's syndrome is\n* ASD\n* PS\n* VSD (Correct Answer)\n* Supravalvular aortic stenosis\n\nExplanation: (D) Supravalvular aortic stenosis # WILLIAMS SYNDROME shares some features with autism (such as difficulty understanding the state of mind of conversational partners) and Fetal alcohol syndrome (e.g., certain facial features, possible mental retardation, and negative potential outbursts), although persons with Williams generally possess very good social skills, such that this condition is sometimes called \"cocktail- party syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is common\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nA17-year-old boy presented with TLC of 138x109/ L with 80% blasts on the peripheral smear. Chest X-ray demonsnstrated a large mediastinal mass. Immunophenotyping of this patent's blasts would most likely demonstrate:\n* No surface antigens (null phenotype) (Correct Answer)\n* An immature T cell phenotype (Tdt/CD34/CD7 positive)\n* Myeloid markers, such as CD13,CD33 and Cd15\n* B cell markers, such as CD19,CD20 and CD22\n\nExplanation: Answer is B (An immature T cell phenotype-Tdt/CD34/CD7 positive) The presence of a mediastinal mass in a young adolescent male suggests the diagnosis of precursor T cell ALL. Precursor T cell ALL is phenotypically characterized by an immature T cell phenotype and is positive for TDT and CD7 and may he positive for CD34. The patient in question has a Tcell ALL (Precursor T cell ALL) Patient is presenting with characteristic clinical features of T cell ALL Occurance in an adolescent age group (17 year old) Occurance in a male (predilection for males) Presence of a mediastinal mass High WBC count > 100,000/mm3 Presursor T cell ALL will show an immature T cell Phenotype and will be positive for CD7 and Td t Immunophenotypic classification for ALL FAB classification Immunologic classification Phenotype Incidence (% cases) Cytogenetic Abnormalities Pre-B Cell Early Pre-B CD19, CD20-/+, CD10, CD34, TdT 55 75 t(9;22), t(4, 11), t(1; 19) Pre-B CD19, CD20+/-, CD10, CD34-, clgM, Tdt+/- 20 B cell B cell CD19, CD20, CD22, CD10+/-, CD34-, Tdt-, slg 5 14q 11 or 7q34 T cell T cell CD1, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10+/-, CD34-/+, Tdt, dual CD4/CD8 20 t(8; 14), t(8; 22), t(2;8)\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nA 55-year-old elderly patient presented with unilateral blindness, unilateral headache lasting for 2 months and shows increased ESR. The diagnosis is\n* Giant cell arteritis (Correct Answer)\n* Migraine\n* Takayesu syndrome\n* None of the above\n\nExplanation: (A) Giant cell arteritis # Giant-cell arteritis (GCA or Temporal arteritis or Cranial arteritis) or Horton disease is an inflammatory disease of blood vessels most commonly involving large and medium arteries of the head. It is a form of vasculitis. Patients present with: bruits; fever; headache; tenderness and sensitivity on the scalp; jaw claudication (pain in jaw when chewing); tongue claudication (pain in tongue when chewing) and necrosis; reduced visual acuity (blurred vision); acute visual loss (sudden blindness); diplopia (double vision); acute tinnitus (ringing in the ears). The inflammation may affect blood supply to the eye and blurred vision or sudden blindness may occur. In 76% of cases involving the eye, the ophthalmic artery is involved causing arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Loss of vision in both eyes may occur very abruptly and this disease is therefore a medical emergency. Laboratory tests: LFTs, liver function tests, are abnormal particularly raised ALP- alkaline phosphatase> Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an inflammatory marker, >60 mm/hour (normal 10-40 mm/hour), but may be normal in approximately 20% of cases.> C-reactive protein, another inflammatory marker, is also commonly elevated.> Platelets may also be elevated. Biopsy: The gold standard for diagnosing temporal arteritis is biopsy, which involves removing a small part of the vessel and examining it microscopically for giant cells infiltrating the tissue. Treatment: Corticosteroids, typically high-dose prednisone (40-60 mg. once daily), must be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected (even before the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy) to prevent irreversible blindness secondary to ophthalmic artery occlusion.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nWhat is the effect of rheumatoid arthritis on the lung?\n* DLco normal\n* CXR is normal (Correct Answer)\n* Exudative pleural effusion\n* Flow volume pattern showing an obstructive pattern\n\nExplanation: Ans. C. Exudative pleural effusionLung Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis* Most common pulmonary manifestation is pleural involvement leading to pleural friction rub and effusion.* This is due to inflammatory breakdown of pulmonary nodules.* Pleural effusions tend to be exudative with increased numbers of monocytes and neutrophils.* Interstitial lung disease. Pulmonary function testing shows a restrictive pattern (e.g. reduced total lung capacity) with a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO).* Caplan's syndrome is characterized by the development of nodules and pneumoconiosis following silica exposure.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nThe Most common lesion in Wernicke's encephalopathy is found in the\n* Dentate nucleus\n* Substatia nigra\n* Motor cortex (Correct Answer)\n* Mamillary bodies\n\nExplanation: (D) Mamillary bodies > Lesions in the periventricular regions of the diencephalon, midbrain, and brainstem as well as the superior vermis of the cerebellum consist of symmetric discoloration of structures surrounding the third ventricle, aqueduct, and fourth ventricle, with petechial hemorrhages in occasional acute cases and atrophy of the mamillary bodies in most chronic cases.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nAll of the following are features of temporal lobe lesions Except:\n* Wernicke's Aphasia\n* Contralateral homonymous superior quadrantanopia\n* Auditory hallucinations (Correct Answer)\n* Hemineglect\n\nExplanation: Answer is D (Hemi neglect): Hemineglect or neglect of contralateral side is a feature of Parietal lobe lesion (Non dominant hemisphere) and is not a feature of temporal lobe lesion. Wernicke's Aphasia contralateral superior homonymous quadrantopia and auditory hollucinations are all features of temporal lobe lesions.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nMauriac's syndrome is characterized by all except\n* Diabetes\n* Obesity\n* Dwarfism (Correct Answer)\n* Cardiomegaly\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., Cardiomegaly Mauriac Sydrome Children with poorly controlled type I diabetes may develop Mauriac syndrome. It is characterized by : - Growth attenuation Delayed pubey Hepatomegaly Abnormal glycogen storage and steatosis Cushingoid features Rare in modern era of insuling therapy but is occasionlly repoed.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nMulti organ failure is defined as failure of minimum how many organs?\n* 2 (Correct Answer)\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n\nExplanation: ANSWER (A) 2REF .-With textSee table of \"Definitions Used to Describe the Condition of Septic Patients\" in Medicine 2013 Session 2, Surgery Post Diploma June 2012Webster's dictionary defines:Multi organ failure (MOF) or multi organ failure syndrome (MOFS) or multi organ dysfunction syndrome { MODS) is defined as progressive dysfunction of two or more major organ systems in a critically ill patient that makes it impossible to maintain homeostasis without medical intervention and that is typically a complication of sepsis and is a major factor in predicting mortality.MODS is dysfunction of more than one organ, requiring intervention to maintain homeostasis (Ref: Harrison 18\" ed Table 271-1)\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nBehcet's disease is characterized by all of the following Except\n* Iritis associated with oral and genital mucocutaneous ulcerations (Correct Answer)\n* Aoic aneurysm is the most common vascular disorder\n* Venous thrombosis is managed with lifelong oral anticoagulation\n* Immunosuppressive therapy is used in Mucocutaneous and eye lesions\n\nExplanation: Behcet's disease is a clinicopathologic entity characterized by recurrent episodes of oral and genital ulcers, iritis, and cutaneous lesions. The underlying pathologic process is a leukocytoclastic venulitis, although vessels of any size and in any organ can be involved.The recurrent aphthous ulcerations are a sine qua non for the diagnosis.Skin involvement is observed in 80% of patients and includes folliculitis, erythema nodosum, an acne-like exanthem, and, infrequently, vasculitis, Sweet syndrome, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Nonspecific skin inflammatory reactivity to any scratches or intradermal saline injection (pathergy test) is a common and specific manifestation.Eye involvement with scarring and bilateral panuveitis is the most dreaded complication since it occasionally progresses rapidly to blindness. In addition to iritis, posterior uveitis, retinal vessel occlusions, and optic neuritis can be seen in some patients with the syndrome.Nondeforming ahritis or ahralgias are seen in 50% of patients and affect the knees and ankles.Superficial or deep peripheral vein thrombosis is seen in 30% of patients. Aerial involvement occurs in less than 5% of patients and presents with aoitis or peripheral aerial aneurysm and aerial thrombosis.Mucous membrane involvement may respond to topical glucocoicoids in the form of mouthwash or paste. In more serious cases, thalidomide (100 mg/d) is effective.Colchicine can be beneficial for the mucocutaneous manifestations and ahritis. Uveitis and CNS-Behcet's syndrome require systemic glucocoicoid therapy (prednisone, 1mg/kg per day) and azathioprine (2-3 mg/kg per day). Cyclosporine (5 mg/kg) has been used for sight-threatening uveitis, alone or in combination with azathioprine.Ref: Harrison; 19th edition; Page no: 2194\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nDrug of choice for treatment of type 2 Brittle Asthma is -\n* b-adrenergic agonist\n* Inhaled corticosteroids\n* Antileukotrines DM (Correct Answer)\n* Subcutaneous epinephrine\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., Subcutaneous epinephrine o Brittle asthma is a type of asthma distinguishable from other forms by recurrent, severe attacks.o There are two subtypes divided by symptoms: Type 1 and Type 2, depending on the stability of the patient's maximum speed of expiration, or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).o Brittle asthma is one of the \"unstable\" subtypes of \"difficult asthma\", a term used to characterize the less than 5% of asthma cases that do not respond to maximal inhaled treatment, including high doses of corticosteroids combined with additional therapies such as long-acting beta-2 agonists.o Oxford Textbook of Medicine distinguishes type 1 brittle asthma by# \"persistent daily chaotic variability in peak flow (usually greater than 40 per cent diurnal variation in PEFR more than 50 per cent of the time)\",o While type 2 is identified by# \"sporadic sudden falls in PEFR against a background of usually well-controlled asthma with normal or near normal lung function\".o In both types, patients are subject to recurrent, severe attacks.o Individuals with type 1 suffer chronic attacks in spite of ongoing medical therapy, while those with type 2 experience sudden, acute and even potentially life-threatening attacks even though otherwise their asthma seems well managed.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nThe test used to diagnose Dubin Johnson syndrome is\n* Serum transminases (Correct Answer)\n* BSP test\n* Hippurate test\n* Gamma glutamyl transferase level\n\nExplanation: Answer is B (Bromsulphalein / Sulfobromophthalein) The appearance of late rise in plasma level of Bromsulphalein, BSF / Sulfobromophthalein in the clearance of this dye has been considered as a oathormontie sign of Dubin Johnson syndrome - Metabolism of Bromsulphalein in D-J syndrome; Digestive diseases and Sciences Vol/17 numbers 6. Patients with D - J syndrome exhibit a characteristic rise in plasma concentration of Bromsulphalein at 90 minutes after injection due to reflux of conjugated BSP into circulation from Hepatocyte. - Harrison Bromsulphalein test for Dubin Johnson syndrome : Harrison 16th / 1821 Dubin Johnson syndrome is characterized by a Familial / Autosomal Recessive defect in Hepatic excretory function (fom hepatocyte to biliary canaliculi ) Biliary excretion of a number of anionic compounds is compromised including that of sulfohromphthalein (Bromsulphalein, BSP), a synthetic dye (cholecystographic agent). To test for D -- J syndrome, the role of disappearance of BSP from plasma is determined after its bolus intravenous administration. Patients with D - J syndrome exhibit a characteristic rise in its plasma concentration at 90 minutes after injection due to reflux of conjugated BSP into circulation from Hepatocyte. -- Harrison Dubin Johnson Syndrome : Review During Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive() hereditary disorder presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemiaQ due to defect in hepatic excretory function across the canalicular membrane of hepatocyte.() Clinical presentation * Most patient are asymptomatic (subclinical chemical hyperbilirubinemia) * Unexplained low grade jaundice during teenage years Often exacerbated by : -- Oral contraceptive use -- Pregnancy -- Intercurrent illness * Physical examination is usually normal (occasional patient may have hepatosplenomegaly) Laboratory studies * Coniuifated Ilvperbilirubinemia :Total bilirubin is typically between 2 -- 5 mg/dl (34 -- 85 ymol/L) May occasionally he Normal or as high as 20-25 mg/dI(340-430 ,umol/L) * Bilirubinitria :Typically present as hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated * Other Routine Liver Function Tests including Serum Transaminases and Alkaline Phosphatase are essentially Normal Diagnosis Bromsulphalein test :Elaborated above Histology : Corporphyrin test Deposition of melanin like pigment occurs in the (Preferential urinary excretion of corporphyrin-l) liver causing liver to appear dark or completely black.

H-17th/pg. 1610; Table 249-3).In most of the cases, the only organism responsible for all allergic symptoms and signs of ABPA is Aspergillus fumigatus.Harrison's 17th/pg. 1610...........\"When an eosinophilic pneumonia is associated with bronchial asthma, it is important to determine if the patient has atopic asthma and has wheal-and-flare skin reactivity to Aspergillus or other relevant fungal antigens. If so, other criteria should be sought for the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or other, rarer examples of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis such as those caused by Penicillium, Candida, Curvularia, or Helminthosporium spp. A. fumigatus is the most common cause of ABPA.\"Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)Diagnostic Features of ABPAMain Diagnostic Criteria:# Bronchial asthma# Pulmonary infiltrates# Peripheral eosinophilia (>1000/L)# Immediate wheal-and-flare response to Aspergillus fumigatus# Serum precipitins to A. fumigatus# Elevated serum IgE# Central bronchiectasisOther Diagnostic Features:# History of brownish plugs in sputum# Culture of A. fumigatus from sputum# Elevated IgE (and IgG) class antibodies specific for A. fumigatusAdditional Educational points:# The chest roentgenogram in ABPA may show transient, recurrent infiltrates or may suggest the presence of proximal bronchiectasis. High-resolution chest CT is a sensitive, noninvasive technique for the recognition of proximal bronchiectasis.# The bronchial asthma of ABPA likely involves an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, whereas the bronchiectasis associated with this disorder is thought to result from a deposition of immune complexes in proximal airways. Adequate Rx usually requires the long-term use of systemic glucocorticoids.\n\n## Question from Medicine:\nnephrotic syndrome is caused by all except ?\n* renal cell carcinoma (Correct Answer)\n* minimal change nephropathy\n* diabetes mellitus\n* rheumatoid ahritis\n\nExplanation: Primary causes Primary causes include- Minimal-change nephropathy(70-90% children and 10- 15%inadult) Focal glomerulosclerosis (15%inadult) Membranous nephropathy (30%inadult) Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis .

This mechanism allows presentation of peptides derived from viruses. Also Know: Cytotoxic (cytolytic) T lymphocytes are also specific effectors of the cellular immune response, paicularly against virus-infected cells. In this example, a virus (e.g., influenza virus) is inhaled and infects a cell of the respiratory tract. Viral envelope glycoproteins appear on the surface of the infected cell in association with class I MHC proteins. A cytotoxic T cell binds its antigen-specific receptor to the viral antigen-class I MHC protein complex and is stimulated to grow into a clone of cells by interleukin-2 produced by helper T cells. These cytotoxic T cells specifically kill influenza virus-infected cells (and not cells infected by other viruses) by recognizing viral antigen-class I MHC protein complexes on the cell surface and releasing perforins that destroy the membrane of the infected cell.

D i.e. Fresh water snail Schistosoma haematobium It is an impoant digenetic trematode, and is found in the Middle East, India, Pougal and Africa. It is a major agent of schistosomiasis; more specifically, it is associated with urinary schistosomiasis. Adults are found in the Venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs traverse the wall of the bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys otherwise known as hydronephrosis. Inflammation of the genitals due to S. haematobium may contribute to the propagation of HIV. Studies have shown the relationship between S. haematobium infection and the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder Life cycle The female fluke lays as many as 30 eggs per day which migrate to the lumen of the urinary bladder and ureters. The eggs are eliminated from the host into the water supply with micturition. In fresh water, the eggs hatch forming free swimming miracidia which penetrate into the intermediate snail host (Bulinus spp., e.g. B. globosus, B. forskalii, B. nyassanus and B. truncatus). Inside the snail, the miracidium sheds it epithelium and develops into a mother sporocyst. After two weeks the mother begins forming daughter sporocysts. Four weeks after the initial penetration of the miracardium into the snail furcocercous cercariae begin to be released. The cercariae cycle from the top of the water to the bottom for three days in the search of a human host. Within half an hour the cercariae enter the host epithelium\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nWhich among the following differentiates Neisseriae meningitis from Neisseriae gonorrhoea?\n* It is oxidase positive\n* It ferments Glucose (Correct Answer)\n* It ferments Maltose\n* It reduces nitrates\n\nExplanation: It ferments Maltose REF: Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg's Medical Microbiology, 24TH edition Chapter 21 Table 21-1. \"Meningococci ferment maltose, while gonococci do not\" Both meningococci & gonococci are Oxidase positive and Glucose fermenting. Neither of them reduces nitrates. Gonococci and meningococci are closely related, with 70% DNA homology, and are differentiated by a few laboratory tests and specific characteristics: Meningococci have polysaccharide capsules, whereas gonococci do not, and meningococci rarely have plasmids whereas most gonococci do. Most impoantly, the two species are differentiated by the usual clinical presentations of the diseases they cause: Meningococci typically are found in the upper respiratory tract and cause meningitis, while gonococci cause genital infections. The clinical spectra of the diseases caused by gonococci and meningococci overlap, however.

Ananthanarayan Microbiology 7th/pg. 31, 86)Most rigid endoscopes are compatible with steam, formaldehyde, ethylene oxide and certain liquid chemical disinfectants. Flexible scope can be sterilized by peracetic acid.CHEMICAL STERILIZATION# Ethylene oxide (EO or EtO) gas- Most common sterilization method .- Used to sterilize objects sensitive to temperatures > 60degC such as plastics, optics and electrics.- Carried out at 30-60degC with relative humidity >30% & gas cone. 200-800 mg/L for at least 3 hrs.- ETO penetrates well, moving through paper, cloth, and some plastic films and is highly effective.- EtO can kill all known viruses, bacteria and fungi; including bacterial spores and is satisfactory.- Bacillus subtilis, a very resistant organism, is used as a rapid biological indicator for EO sterilizers.# Glutaraldehyde# Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant.# It is specifically effective against tubercle bacilli, fungi, and viruses.# Has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive.# It is less toxic and irritant to eyes than formaldehyde.# To kill all spores in liquid can take upto 12 hrs with gluteraldehyde & longer with formaldehyde.# It has no deleterious effect on the cement or lenses of instruments like cystoscopes and bronchoscopes.# It can safely be used to treat corrugated rubber anesthetic tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal tubes, polythene tubing, and metal instruments.# CIDEX (2% gluteraldehyde) is commonly used for sterilization of endoscopes.# Formaldehyde# It is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life, but is much more volatile.# Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent.# Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.# Ozone is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced onsite, so it is not practical to use in many settings.# Chlorine bleach is another accepted liquid sterilizing agent. Household bleach consists of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. It is usually diluted to 1/10 immediately before use; however to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis it should be diluted only 1/5. The dilution factor must take into account the volume of any liquid waste that it is being used to sterilize. Bleach will kill many organisms immediately, but for full sterilization it should be allowed to react for 20 minutes. Bleach will kill many, but not all spores. It is highly corrosive and may corrode even stainless steel surgical instruments.# Chlorine and NaOH are the most consistent agents for prions. Chlorine is too corrosive to use on certain objects. NaOH has had many studies showing its effectiveness.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nThayer martin agar medium is for:\n* N.

Pugh and Johannes ipsen\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nA 35-year-old man develops hemiparesis, ataxia, homonymous hemianopia, and cognitive deterioration. An MRI of the brain demonstrates widespread areas of abnormal T2 signal in the white matter. An electroencephalogram is remarkable for diffuse slowing over both cerebral hemispheres. Brain biopsy reveals demyelination with abnormal giant oligodendrocytes, some of which contain eosinophilic inclusions. This patient's condition is most closely related to which of the following diseases?\n* AIDS (Correct Answer)\n* Chickenpox\n* Measles\n* Syphilis\n\nExplanation: The condition is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which is a rapidly progressive demyelinating disorder in which the JC virus (a papovavirus) infects oligodendroglial cells in the brain. The eosinophilic inclusions represent accumulations of JC virus. PML occurs in about 1% of AIDS patients, and is the AIDS-defining illness in half of the patients who develop the condition. There is no effective treatment for this disorder. Shingles and post-infectious encephalitis can follow chickenpox, but varicella is not associated specifically with demyelination. Measles can cause an encephalitis, and in some cases, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) may follow previous measles infection. These disorders would affect not only white matter, but gray matter as well. Also, SSPE usually occurs before the age of 18. Syphilis can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord damage, but the disease process would not be limited to the white matter.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nStreptococcus pyogenes is\n* Gram positive cocci (Correct Answer)\n* Gram negative cocci\n* Gram positive bacilli\n* Gram negative bacilli\n\nExplanation: Streptococci are the gram-positive cocci arranged in chains or pairs. Gram-positive cells have a more acidic protoplasm, which may account for retaining the basic primary dye more strongly than gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria are those that resist decolorization and retain the primary stain appearing violet.

Of the 15 HA subtypes found in birds, only a few have been transferred to mammals (H1, H2, H3, and H5 in humans; H1 and H3 in swine; and H3 and H7 in horses). The same pattern holds for NA; nine NA subtypes are known for birds, only two of which are found in humans (N1, N2). This pandemic strain of H1N1 causes a broad range of clinical symptoms ranging from typical symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgias, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, shoness of breath) commonly accompanied by gastrointestinal manifestations (especially diarrhea) to fulminant viral pneumonia.

Rather progeny virions synthesize new envelop (by self protein and host lipid). Sequence of events is as follows :-Attachement of parent enveloped virus into host cell|Uncoating (removal) of envelop with injection of viralnucleic acid into host cell|Multiplication of nucleic acid and synthesis of structural protein|Maturation of daughter virion|Envelope (lipid) derived from host cell membrane duringthe process of budding|Incorporation of virus coded protein in lipid envelop derivedfrom host cells to make lipoprotein envelop|Release of progeng virions\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nTachyzoites are seen in -\n* Toxoplasma (Correct Answer)\n* Toxocara\n* Pulmonary eosinopjilia\n* Ascaris\n\nExplanation: rapidly multiplying Proliferative forms of trophozoites In pseudocyst seen in acute infection (refer pgno:64 baveja 3 rd edition)\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nAll are true about campylobacter jejuni except.\n* Gram negative\n* Gull wing shaped bacteria (Correct Answer)\n* Warthin starry silver stain is used to demonstrate\n* Erythromycin is DOC\n\nExplanation: Warthin starry silver stain is used for H.pylori.\nSkirrow's media is used in Campylobacter jejuni.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nIn a patient with a Salmonella infection, which of the following mechanisms will most likely be the earliest adaptive response for clearing the infection while bacteria are present within intracellular endosomes?\n* Antibody mediated neutralization of free bacteria\n* Complement mediated lysis of infected host cells\n* CTL recognition of bacterial peptides presented by MHC class II (Correct Answer)\n* DTH responses generated by CD4 +T cells\n\nExplanation: Ans. (d)DTH responses are generally the first effective responses involved in clearance of intraendosomal microbes. Later in such infections, the microbes or their molecules may escape into the cytoplasm, making it possible for Cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to develop. Complement does not clear active intracellular infections. Antibodies maybe effective in inhibiting reinfection but do not cleat active intracellular infections.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nGlomerulonephritis in streptococcal infection is diagnosed by -\n* Blood culture\n* Throat culture (Correct Answer)\n* ASO Titre\n* PCR\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., ASO Titre\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nCat is an agent for transmission of the following disease of man -\n* Isospora hominis\n* Fasciola hepatica (Correct Answer)\n* Toxoplasma gondii\n* Chilomastrix mensili\n\nExplanation: Cat and other felines- definitive host Human - intermediate host (Refer pgno:64 baveja 3 rd edition)\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nA VDRL reactive mother gave bih to an infant. All of the following would help in determining the risk of transmission to the infant, EXCEPT:\n* TPHA test on the serum sample of the mother (Correct Answer)\n* TPHA test on the serum sample of the infant\n* VDRL on the paired serum sample of the infant and mother\n* Time interval between the treatment of the mother and her delivery\n\nExplanation: The likely diagnosis of congenital syphilis is made on the basis of maternal serology and whether or not the mother has been adequately treated during pregnancy. Serological diagnosis of syphilis in neonates is not reliable.

Whereas Pneumocystis Jiroveci may be associated with Pneumatocele and can be diagnosed by sputum examination and commonly causes disease only in the immuno-compromised people. Ref: Medical Microbiology By Jawetz, 24th Edition, Pages 648-49; Washington Manual of Pulmonary Medicine, 2006, Page 104; Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th Edition, Pages 1194-95; Pneumocystis Pneumonia By Walzer, Cushion, 3rd Edition, Page 418\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nWhich of the following statements is true regarding kappa, lambda and heavy chain immunoglobins -\n* Coded in the same site of a chromosome\n* Coded in different sites of same chromosome (Correct Answer)\n* The chains are formed by genetic rearrangement after maturation\n* Different chains of same immunoglobulins are coded by different chromosomes\n\nExplanation: The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces--known as gene segments (subgenus). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments.V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different paratopes, and thus different antigen specificities.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nNegri bodies are seen in:(1994)\n* Rabies (Correct Answer)\n* Small pox\n* Trachoma\n* Lymphogranuloma venerum\n\nExplanation: Ans: a\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nSARS is a type of\n* Rhinovirus\n* Lenti virus\n* Calcivirus (Correct Answer)\n* Corona virus\n\nExplanation: The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV):*Virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)*It belongs to coronaviridae*November 2002, Guangdong province in south China experienced an outbreak of an unusual respiratory infection, with many deaths (Ref: Ananthanarayan 9th edition, p559-560)\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nWhich of the following statements about Hepatitis 'C' is true -\n* DNA virus (Correct Answer)\n* Most common indication for liver transplant\n* Does not cause liver cancer\n* cause coinfection with hepatitis B\n\nExplanation: HCV is TNA virus. doesnot cause coinfection with HBV.it is transmitted mainly by blood transfusion, transplant recipients REF:MICROBIOLOGY ANANTHA NARAYANAN NINTH EDITION PAGE.548\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nA 40-year-old woman presented to the gyencologist with complaint of profuse vaginal discharge. There was no discharge from the cervical os on the speculum examination. The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was made based upon all of the following findings on microscopy except:\n* Abundance of gram variable coccobacilli\n* Absence of Lactobacilli (Correct Answer)\n* Abundance of polymorphs\n* Presence of clue cells\n\nExplanation: Ans. (c) Abundance of polymorphs Ref Shaw's 13/e p 129: COCDT 10, p 670 Bacterial Vaginosis Defined as alteration in normal vaginal flora rather than true infection Causative organism: - G. vaginalis H. vaginalis - Mobiluncus Microscopy of vaginal secretions in bacterial vaginosis shows: - Characteristic clue cells - Decreased or absent lactobacillus - Decreased leucocytes. Clinical criteria for diagnosis: - Homogenous white non inflammatory discharge with fishy odour. - Microscopic presence of >20% clue cells. Vaginal discharge with pH > 4.5 - Fishy odor with or without addition of 10% KOH. Treatment: Metronidazole for both pregnant and non-pregnant women. Remember: Clue cells represent epithelial cells adherant to G. vaginalis. Bacterial vaginosis is most prevalent vaginal infection.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nA mother and newborn are exposed to a pathogen while at the hospital for a routine checkup and breastfeeding clinic. This same pathogen had infected the mother about a year previously, and she had successfully recovered from the subsequent illness. Immunity may be innate or acquired. Which of the following best describes acquired immunity with respect to the newborn?\n* Complement cascade\n* Increase in C-reactive protein (CRP)\n* Inflammatory response (Correct Answer)\n* Maternal transfer of antibody\n\nExplanation: Maternal transfer of antibody (secretory IgA in the colostrum of breast milk), however, is passive but still confers specific immunity. It is termed passive acquired immunity. Natural immunity is nonspecific. The natural immune functions described are not specific for a certain antigen. For example, certain proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) are acute-phase reactants. While elevated CRP is seen in infection, it is not disease specific.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nA boy with skin ulcer on leg, culture reveals beta hemolysis. Cultures from school children with sore throat some days back also revealed beta hemolysis. What is the similarity between bothaEUR'\n* Mec A gene is related to it\n* M protein is same (Correct Answer)\n* C carbohydrate antigen is same\n* Strains causing both are same\n\nExplanation: C carbohydrate antigen is the same [Ref: Ananthnarayan 8/e p 205-101 fi Hemolysis in an organism causing skin infections and sore throat suggests streptococcus pyogenes or Group A streptococcus infection. Group A streptococcus commonly causes : Skin infections (impetigo, Erysipelas) Sore throat (pharyngitis) Streptococci are first classified on the basis of their hemolytic propeies The fi hemolytic streptococci or the hemolytic streptococci are fuher classified based on the nature of a carbohydrate antigen present in the cell wall. - This classification is based upon antigenic differences in the group specific polysaccharide located in the bacterial cell wall. - More than 20 serologic groups have been identified and are designated by letters (A - V) except 1 and G. The carbohydrate or the \"C\" antigen are \"group specific\" i.e.,a paicular group will have a specific antigen. - The \"C antigen\" or the carbohydrate antigen would be same in all the streptococci of a paicular group. Majority of streptococci that produce human infections belong to group \"A\" also known as streptococcus pyogenes. The group \"A\" streptococci are fuher subdivided into type specific antisera Griffith based on M proteins. \"Streptococcus A\" or streptococcus pyogenes is an impoant cause of human infections. The two most common infections associated with streptococcus are . ? Skin infections --> Impetigo, Erysipelas Throat infections --> Pharyngitis The streptococcus bacteria causing the two infections belongs to the same lancefield group they both have same carbohydrate A antigen in their cell wall but they have difference in their surface M protein, i.e. they belong to different strains of streptococcus A. -Base on M protein the streptococcal 'A' group is divided into 80 strains. - Different strains of streptococci are associated with different infections. The throat infection and the skin infection are caused by different strains of the same lancefield group of streptococci. - A paicular lancefied group is divided into different strains based on \"M proteins\". -The M protein in the strain causing pharyngitis is quite different from the strain causing impetigo. - But both these strains belong to the same lancefield group and contains the same carbohydrate (A) antigen. - Impetigo is caused by higher number of M types 49, 53-55 - Throat infection caused by lower number M types Serotypes 1, 12 The question asks about the similarity between the two bacterias which is the presence of same carbohydrate antigen in their cell wall.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nMost common manifestation of congenital toxoplasmosis\n* Hydrocephalus (Correct Answer)\n* Chorioretinitis\n* Calcification\n* Convulsions\n\nExplanation: Most common - Chorioretinitis\nIn adults - Cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nDengue fever vector is a\n* Anopheles (Correct Answer)\n* Aedes\n* Culex\n* Mansoni\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nDonovan bodies are:\n* Leukocytes that contain the organism, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis\n* EosinophiLs that contain the organism, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis\n* Monocytes that contain the organism, Haemophilus influenza (Correct Answer)\n* Monocytes that contain the organism, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis\n\nExplanation: Monocytes that contain the organism, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nToxin of emetic strain of bacillus cereus resembles in action of\n* Heat stable toxin of S.aureus (Correct Answer)\n* Heat labile toxin of E.coli\n* Cholera toxin\n* Pseudomonas toxin\n\nExplanation: It is a preformed toxin similar to S.aureus enterotoxin.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nWhich of the following events occur first in the differentiation sequence of human B cells in the bone marrow?\n* Cytoplasmic mu chains present in the B cell (Correct Answer)\n* Immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement\n* Immunoglobulin light chain rearrangement\n* Surface IgD and IgM present on the B cell\n\nExplanation: The first event that occurs in the pre-B cell (progenitor) is the gene rearrangement of the heavy chain. The D gene and J gene recombination event occurs first, followed by V recombination with the D-J region. The cytoplasmic mu chains are the result of immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement, the production of the messenger RNA from this rearrangement, and the ribosomal synthesis of the protein mu chain. This is the second event that occurs in the B-cell maturational sequence. Light chain rearrangement occurs when recombination events occur with the V gene and J gene from the light chain germline. After this recombination has occurred, and the messenger RNA for this germ line has produced the light chain protein, the light chains and heavy chains form. The complete IgM molecule and IgD molecules are present on the surface of only the mature B cells. This event is the last event to occur during the differentiation and development of B cells in the bone marrow. Ref: Brooks G.F., Carroll K.C., Butel J.S., Morse S.A., Mietzneron T.A. (2010).

It is produced intracellularly and appears in the medium only on the death and auto lysis of the cell.o It is the most toxic substance known,o Toxin is heat labile, but spores are highly heat resistant.o It acts by blocking the release of acetylcholine at synapses and neuromuscular junction. It acts presynaptically.o Toxin of all types (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) are neurotoxin except C2 which is a cytotoxin (enter otoxin).\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nTrue abour Herpes virus\n* HSV 1 causes encephalitis (Correct Answer)\n* EBV affects\n* CMV is always symptomatic\n* Herpes zoster is not activated\n\nExplanation: HSV encephalitis though rare is most common sporadic acute viral encephalitis in most pas of the world. REF:ANATHANARAYAN AND PANIKER'S TEXTBOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY 8TH EDITION PAGE NO:469\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nNot an enrichment medium ?\n* Selenite F broth\n* Tetrathionate broth\n* Alkaline peptone water (Correct Answer)\n* Loeffler's serum\n\nExplanation: Ans. is `d' i.e., Loeffler's serum\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nTrue about Mycoplasma:\n* CO2 is important for growth\n* Does not cause hemolysis (Correct Answer)\n* May be commensal in throat\n* Acid fast bacillus\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., May be commensal in throat(Ref: Ananthanarayan, 8th/e, 589, 7th/e, p. 600 and 9th/e, p. 386; Harrison, 19th/e, p. 1163)\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nEndoscopes (e.g., cystoscopes, gastroscopes) should be sterilized with\n* Glutaraldehyde (Correct Answer)\n* Ethylene oxide\n* Benzalakonium\n* Betapropiolactone\n\nExplanation: Most rigid endoscopes are compatible with steam, formaldehyde, ethylene oxide and certain liquid chemical disinfectants. The flexible scope can be sterilized by peracetic acid.\nCHEMICAL STERILIZATION\n■ Ethylene oxide (EO or EtO) gas - Most common sterilization method . -\nUsed to sterilize objects sensitive to temperatures > 60°C such as plastics, optics and electrics. -\nCarried out at 30-60°C with relative humidity >30% & gas cone. 200-800 mg/L for at least 3 hrs. -\nETO penetrates well, moving through paper, cloth, and some plastic films and is highly effective. -\nEtO can kill all known viruses, bacteria and fungi; including bacterial spores and is satisfactory. - Bacillus subtilis, a very resistant organism, is used as a rapid biological indicator for EO sterilizers. ■ Glutaraldehyde ■ Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant.\n■ It is specifically effective against tubercle bacilli, fungi, and viruses. ■ Has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive.\n■ It is less toxic and irritant to eyes than formaldehyde. ■ To kill all spores in the liquid can take upto 12 hrs with glutaraldehyde & longer with formaldehyde.\n■ It has no deleterious effect on the cement or lenses of instruments like cystoscopes and bronchoscopes.\n■ It can safely be used to treat corrugated rubber anesthetic tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal tubes, polythene tubing, and metal instruments.\n■ CIDEX (2% glutaraldehyde) is commonly used for sterilization of endoscopes.\n■ Formaldehyde\n■ It is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life, but is much more volatile.\n■ Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent.\n■ Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.\n■ Ozone is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most organic matter.\nOn the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced onsite, so it is not practical to use in many settings.\n■ Chlorine bleach is another accepted liquid sterilizing agent. Household bleach consists of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. It is usually diluted to 1/10 immediately before use; however, to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis it should be diluted only 1/5. The dilution factor must take into account the volume of any liquid waste that it is being used to sterilize. Bleach will kill many organisms immediately, but for full sterilization, it should be allowed to react for 20 minutes. Bleach will kill many, but not all spores. It is highly corrosive and may corrode even stainless steel surgical instruments.\n■ Chlorine and NaOH are the most consistent agents for prions. Chlorine is too corrosive to use on certain objects. NaOH has had many studies showing its effectiveness\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nIntravascular hemolysis is mediated by: September 2007\n* IgA\n* IgD\n* IgE (Correct Answer)\n* IgG\n\nExplanation: Ans. D: IgG In a transfusion reaction or in alloimmune hemolytic anemia antibody mediated lysis of red blood cells involves triggering of the complement cascade. Some microbes form substances called hemolysins that have the specific action of destroying red blood cells; beta-hemolytic streptococci are an example. Intravenous administration of a hypotonic solution or plain distilled water will cause the red cells to fill with fluid until their membranes rupture and the cells are destroyed. Wherever either in vitro or in vivo IgG or IgM antibodies are bound to red blood cell antigens in the presence of complement, the complement cascade is triggered the final products of which include enzymes that result in holes being 'punched' in the wall of the red blood cell, allowing hemoglobin to escape and which is observed as lysis. Snake venoms and ceain plant substances may cause hemolysis. A great variety of chemical agents can lead to destruction of erythrocytes if there is exposure to a sufficiently high concentration of the substance. These chemical hemolytics include copper. Disorder of the immune response in which antibodies are made to 'self' red blood cell antigens resulting in the lysis of the cells (autoimmune hemolytic anemia)\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nNegative Mantoux test is when induration is\n* <10 mm\n* <15 mm\n* <20 mm (Correct Answer)\n* <5 mm\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nGlucocoicoids lead to an increase in blood levels of which of the following?\n* Neutrophils (Correct Answer)\n* Eosinophils\n* Basophils\n* Lymphocytes\n\nExplanation: Effects of glucocoicoids:Increased plasma levels ofDecreased plasma levels of* Neutrophils* Lymphocytes* RBCs* Eosinophils* Platelets* Basophils\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nPneumococcus can be differentiated from streptococcus by\n* Type of hemolysis\n* Gram staining\n* Growth characteristics (Correct Answer)\n* Bile solubility\n\nExplanation: Bile solubility test: Streptococcus pneumoniae are bile soluble. If a few drops of 10% sodium deoxycholate solution are added to 1 ml of an overnight broth culture, the culture clears due to the Lysis of cocci. Alternatively, if a loopful of 10 % deoxycholate solution is placed on a Streptococcus pneumoniae colony on blood agar, the colony lyses within a few minutes. Bile solubility is a constant propey of Streptococcus pneumoniae and is of diagnostic impoance from other streptococci. The test should be carried out at neutral PH using deoxycholate and living young cells in saline suspension. Principal: based on the presence of an autolytic amidase in Streptococcus pneumoniae that cleaves the bond between an alanine and muramic acid in the peptidoglycan. The amidase is activated by surface active agents such as bile or bile salts.

Later, gene rearrangement generates antibodies of the same antigenic specificity but of different immunoglobulin classes. In class switching, the same assembled VH gene can sequentially associate with different CH genes, so that the immunoglobulin produced later (IgG, IgA, or IgE) has the same specificity as the original IgM but with different biologic characteristics. Class switching is dependent on cytokines released from T cells. Recently, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-g, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF -b) have been shown to play a role in regulating Ig class switching.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nCapacity, of producing IgG stas at what age -\n* 6 months (Correct Answer)\n* 1 year\n* 2 years\n* 3 years\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., 6 months\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nMechanism similar to Schwartzman reaction occurs in:\n* Fitz Hugh Curtis syndrome (Correct Answer)\n* Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome\n* Eichwald slimser effect\n* Anaphylactoid reaction\n\nExplanation: Ans.

It produced lytic infection in fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes but could not be established in permanent cell lines. In 1984, Robe Gallo and colleagues from the National Institute of Health, USA, repoed isolation of a retrovirus from AIDS patients and called it 'human T-cell lymphotropic virus-HI (HTLV-I11). Other similar isolates were repoed from AIDS cases under different names. To resolve this nomenclatural confusion, the International Committee on Virus Nomenclature in 1986 decided on the generic name 'human immunodeficiency virus' (HIV) for these viruses. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) The first indication of a new syndrome came in the summer of 1981, with repos from New York and Loss Angeles (USA) of a sudden unexplained outbreak of two very rare diseases-Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (now pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) in young adults who were homosexuals or addicted to injected narcotics. They appeared to have lost their immune competence, rendering them vulnerable to overwhelming and fatal infections with relatively avirulent micro-organisms, as well as to lymphoid and other malignancies. This condition was given the name 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' (AIDS). In 1983, Luc Montagnier and colleagues from the Pasteur Institute, Paris, isolated a retrovirus from a West African patient with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, which is a manifestation of AIDS, and called it lymphadenopathy associated virus' (LAV). It produced lyric infection in fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes but could not be established in permanent cell lines. In 1984, Robe Gallo and colleagues from the National Institute of Health, USA, repoed isolation of a retrovirus from AIDS patients and called it 'human T-cell lymphotropic virus-DI (HTLV-III). Other similar isolates were repoed from AIDS cases under different names.

History reveals that the baby's mother died of AIDS 2 months ago. Blood is obtained and sent to the laboratory to check for HIV infection. The physician orders a test whose detection system is based on enzymatic activity. Which of the following tests is a heterogeneous immunoassay?\n* Coagglutination (COA)\n* Counter immuno-electrophoresis (CIE) (Correct Answer)\n* Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n* Latex agglutination (LA)\n\nExplanation: Of the many methods available for antigen and antibody detection, LA, ELISA, RIA, CIE, and COA are the most widely used.Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) can be either homogeneous (EMIT) or heterogeneous (ELISA). EMIT has been used primarily for assays of low- molecular-weight drugs. Its primary use in microbiology has been for assays of aminoglycoside antibiotics. EIAs vary as to the solid support used. A variety of supports can be used, such as polystyrene microdilution plates, paddles, plastic beads, and tubes. The number of layers in the antibody-antigen sandwich varies; usually as additional layers are added, detection sensitivity is increased. The two most common enzymes are horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). b-Galactosidase has also been employed. O-phenylenediamine is the most common substrate for HRP and b-nitrophenyl phosphate for AP. Because EIAs are usually read in the visible color range, the tests can be read qualitatively by eye or quantitatively by machine.\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nCongenital toxoplasmosis false is aEUR'\n* IgA is better than IgM in detection\n* Diagnosed by detection of IgM in cord blood (Correct Answer)\n* IgG is diagnostic\n* Not recalled\n\nExplanation: IgG is diagnostic Repeat .from May 10 Q no.122\n\n## Question from Microbiology:\nMultilocular hydatid cysts are caused by:\n* E. granulosus (Correct Answer)\n* E. multilocularis\n* Clonorchis sinensis\n* Paragonimus westermani\n\nExplanation: Ans. b (Echinococcus multilocularis).

Ophthalmologic examination is remarkable for bilateral, white opacifications in her eyes, consistent with cataract formation. In which of the following structures are the opacifications located?\n* Aqueous humor\n* Cornea (Correct Answer)\n* Lens\n* Optic nerve\n\nExplanation: Cataracts are lens opacifications. It is not known whether senile cataracts represent disease or normal opacification with age. Cataracts may occur as a consequence of diabetes mellitus, long-term steroids, or congenital infections. They are successfully treated at present with lens extractions and implantation of prosthetic lenses. Note: Aqueous humor is continually replaced due to active secretion by the ciliary body. As such, it does not undergo opacification; it is in constant flux. Corneal opacification is generally a consequence of squamous metaplasia, in which the transparent, non-keratinized, squamous cells are replaced by opaque, keratinized, squamous cells. Squamous metaplasia is a reparative process, usually due to friction injury to the cornea or vitamin A deficiency. The optic nerve is not transparent, and it does not undergo opacification injury. It may, however, atrophy due to ischemic, traumatic, infective, or metabolic insults. Ref: Harper R.A., Shock J.P. (2011). Chapter 8. Lens. In P. Riordan-Eva, E.T.

Atropine 1% eye ointment is used for refraction & fundus examination in children, especially those less than 5 years of age Q and those with darkly pigmented irises. Systemic absorption of atropine may lead to facial flushing hence ointment is preferred over drops in young children.Q. Atropine 1% drops or ointment may also be used as penalization therapy, in the better eye, in patients with amblyopia. Prolonged atropine use may cause contact dermatitis. - Drugs used as mydriatics include-atropine, homatropiine, cyclopentolate, tropicamide, & phenylephrineQ. Cocaine also have cycloplegic Q propey. - Pirenzepine & Telenzepine are selective M1 muscarinic receptor blockers which inhibits gastric secretions without producing typical atropinic side effects (these are due to blockage of M2 & M3 receptors) Because accomodation is almost exclusively mediated parasympathetic pathways, it is antagonized best with muscarinic blockers (antagonists). So muscuranic antagonit always cause cycloplegia (= paralysis of accommodation) with mydriasis (pupil dilatationQ). Anticholinergic (anti muscarinic) agents are tropicamide, cyclopentolate, homatropine, scopolamine (hyoscine) and atropine.

Mechanism of action: Heterotrimeric Transducin (alpha-beta-gamma subunits) is activated by a conformational change in rhodopsin due to the absorption of a photon by rhodopsin's active group retinal. Activation causes the GDP bound to the alpha subunit to be exchanged with GTP from solution and results in activated alpha dissociating from beta-gamma. Active Transducin-alpha then causes cyclic GMP Phosphodiesterase to increase its activity, thereby lowering the concentration of cGMP, an intracellular second-messenger molecule. Decrease in cGMP concentration leads to the closure of cGMP-regulated Na+ and Ca2+ ion channels and a hyperpolarized membrane potential. This chain of signaling events is also called \"the veebrate photo transduction cascade\"\n\n## Question from Ophthalmology:\nAll the following are true regarding acute anterior uveitis in ankylosing spondylitis EXCEPT –\n* More common in female (Correct Answer)\n* Recurrent attacks occur\n* Fibrous reaction in anterior chambers\n* Narrowing of joint spaces and sclerosis of the sacroiliac joints\n\nExplanation: Ankylosing spondylitis is more common in males.\n\n## Question from Ophthalmology:\nTrantas spots are seen in –\n* Vernal conjunctivitis (Correct Answer)\n* Eczematous conjunctivitis\n* Ophthalmia nodosa\n* Tularemia\n\nExplanation: Tranta's spots (Horner tranta's spots) are discrete white raised dots along the limbus and are composed of degenerated eosinophils.\n\n## Question from Ophthalmology:\nTreatment of mooren's ulcer is?\n* Topical steroids\n* Corneal graft\n* Immunosuppressives (Correct Answer)\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: Ans.

(Ref. Essential Orthopedics by Maheshwari, 2nd ed., 268)Perthes disease can occur between the age of 3 to 12 years, with peak incidence between 4 & 8 years.While slipped femoral epiphysis is mostly seen after 10 years of age.PERTHES' DISEASE (CALVE-LEGG-PERTHES' DISEASE)# Usually presents with a limp or pain in the groin.# Symptoms are due to avascular necrosis of the femoral capital epiphysis.# Bilateral in 5-20% of cases.# More common in boys# Usually occurs between 4 and 8 years of age.# The diagnosis is usually made on plain radiography - The earliest sign is increase in the affected hip's joint space (a nonspecific finding).- As the condition develops, subarticular lucencies become visible within the femoral capital epiphysis, which may later become flattened with loss of the perfect round appearance, sclerotic and fragmented.- The epiphysis may also be extruded laterally (an important prognostic indicator) and 25% of children will need additional treatment to contain the femoral head.- The epiphyseal changes may excite a reaction in the adjacent metaphysis with the development of cysts and coxa magna and this too indicates a poorer prognosis.- Early in the disease, subtle changes may only be visible on a frog leg lateral view, which should be performed initially and occasionally in follow up.# Ultrasound can demonstrate irregularity of the anterior and superior surfaces of the femoral capital epiphysis consistent with Perthes' disease.# MRI is sensitive as well as more specific (Investigation of choice).SLIPPED UPPER FEMORAL CAPITAL EPIPHYSIS# More common in boys, May be bilateral ; Usually presents without a history of trauma.# Classically occurs in overweight adolescents who complain of pain or limping.# Initial investigation is with plain radiography and an AP pelvis allows the hips to be compared and a check made for early contralateral abnormality.# If epiphysis has slipped, a line drawn along superior surface of femoral neck will not pass through it.# Additionally, the proximal femoral growth plate may have an indistinct appearance.# If the frontal view is normal a true lateral or frog leg view of the symptomatic hip must also be obtained as this will reveal earlier and more subtle movement of the epiphysis downwards and inwards, and allow early fixation.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nMuscles paralysed in Erb's paralysis are all except -\n* Biceps (Correct Answer)\n* Triceps\n* Brachioradialis\n* Brachialis\n\nExplanation: Erb&; s palsy is due to injury to the C5 nerve root & rarely the C6 nerve root is injured . * Effects of injury - at shoulder : paralysis of deltoid , rhomboids , supra & infraspinatus & teres minor muscles . This results in loss of shoulder abduction & external rotation . - at elbow : biceps & brachialis muscles are paralyzed . This results in loss of flexion of elbow joint. - at forearm : supinator muscle paralyzed resulting in loss of supination of forearm - combined effect of injury is an arm hanging loose by the side of the trunk . The shoulder is internally rotated , the elbow is in extension , forearm is pronated & wrist is in flexion . This characteristic posture is popularly known as policeman or waiter &;s tip. - apa from this , there may sensory loss on outer aspects of the forearm both in front & back.

But, it is recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation.\nHill--sack lesion is a compression fracture of the posterolateral articular surface of the humeral head. With the trauma of repeated dislocation, the humeral head is forced upon glenoid rim and the relatively soft bone of humeral head is crushed. The end result is an impression of the glenoid rim that is made on the humeral head.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nMeniscal injury occurs during:\n* Rotation\n* Extension (Correct Answer)\n* Rotation and Flexion\n* Flexion\n\nExplanation: Ref: Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures, 8th ed.Explanation:Mechanism of injury to MeniscusDamage to the meniscus is due to rotational forces directed to a flexed knee (as may occur w-ith twisting sports) is the usual underlying mechanism of injury.A valgus force applied to a Hexed knee with the foot planted and the femur rotated externally can result in a lateral meniscus tear.A varus force applied to the flexed knee when the foot is planted and the femur rotated internally can result in a tear of the medial meniscus.Symptoms and SignsThe patient's chief complaints are usually knee pain and swellingAnother typical complaint i s joint locking, when the patient is unable to straighten the leg fully. This can be accompanied by a clicking feeling.A tear of the meniscus commonly follows a trauma which involves rotation of the knee while it was slightly bent.In meniscal tears, pressing on the joint line on the affected side typically produces tenderness.The McMurrav test involves pressing on the joint line while stressing the meniscus fusing flexion-extension movements and varus or valgus stress).Stein man n test (with the patient sitting) and the Apley grind test (a grinding maneuver while the patient lies prone and the knee is bent 90deg) also elicit painBending the knee (into hyperflexion if tolerable), and especially squatting, is typically a painful maneuver if the meniscus is tornThe Cooper's sign is a subjective symptom of pain in the affected knee when turning over in bed at night.Meniscal tear causes pain with a twisting motion of the knee as the meniscal fragment gets pinched, and the capsular attachment gets stretched causing the complaint of pain.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nA most common complication of scaphoid fracture\n* Malunion (Correct Answer)\n* Avascular necrosis\n* Wrist stiffners\n* Arthritis\n\nExplanation: Avascular necrosis is associated with long-term steroid use and drinking too much alcohol.

After sometime osteointegration over prosthesis takes place.\n\nIn cemented THR, there may be loosening of the prosthesis. If it occurs without infection, it is called aseptic loosening (or osteolysis).\nParticles of metal (titanium, nickel, chromium etc), cement (PMMA) and polyethene all can produce periprosthetic osteolysis (aseptic loosening); but because they are most numerous polyethene particles appear to be the major culprit.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nMain blood supply to the head and neck of femur comes from\n* Lateral circumflex femoral Aery (Correct Answer)\n* Medial circumflex femoral Aery\n* Aery of Ligamentum Teres\n* Popliteal Aery\n\nExplanation: Main blood supply to the head of the femur in adults is the lateral ascending cervical or retinacular & epiphyseal branches of the medial circumflex femoral aery. It also receives supply from lateral circumflex femoral aery & branch of obturator aery.

What dose of methyl prednisolone is to be given:\n* 30 mg/kg within 3 hrs (Correct Answer)\n* 45 mg/kg within 6 hrs\n* 60 mg/i:g within 9 hrs\n* 75 mg/kg within 12 hrs\n\nExplanation: Ans is 'a' i.e. 30 mg/kg within 3 hrs Methylprednisolone has got potent antiinflammatory properties and thus has been used for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury. Some sensory and motor improvements have been reported when methylprednisolone is administered within 8 hours after spinal cord injury.Methylprednisolone infused 8 hours or more after injury seemed to be of no benefitThe National Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) has conducted three trials I, II and III on early high dose steroids after spinal cord injury. Acute steroid therapy is believed to reduce the cellular damage resulting from secondary injury processes such as lipid peroxidation.Recommended protocol for acute spinal cord injury is:30 mg/kg bolus within 8 hrs of injury followed by twenty three hours of infusion at 5.4 mg/kg per hourHigh dose of steroids has its associated side effects such as increased incidence of wound infection and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.It must also be mentioned that the use of high dose steroids after acute spinal cord injury is highly controversial and has been refuted by many authors.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nCommonest ligament injured in an ankle injury\n* Calcaneofibular ligament\n* Posterior talofibular ligament\n* Spring ligament (Correct Answer)\n* Anterior talofibular ligament\n\nExplanation: The ankle is one of the most common sites for acute musculoskeletal injuries.\n\nSprains constitute 85% of all ankle injuries, and 85% of those involve a lateral inversion mechanism,\n\nInversion Sprain - Inversion ankle sprains occur when the foot turns in or out to an abnormal degree relative to the ankle.\n\nThe most common mechanism of an ankle sprain is a combination of plantarflexion and inversion where the foot is pointing downward and inward.\n\nThe lateral ligaments are involved in an inversion ankle sprain and hence most commonly damaged.\n\nThese ligaments are on the outside of the ankle, which includes the anterior talofibular {ATFL), calcaneofibular (CFL) and posterior talofibular ligaments (PTFL).\nInjury to the ATFL is the most common. When both the ATFL and CFL are injured together, ankle instability will be more noticeable.\nThe PTFL is the strongest of the three ligaments and is rarely injured in an inversion sprain.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nComplication of Colle's fracture include all of the following except :\n* Malunion (Correct Answer)\n* Nonunion\n* Sudeck's osteodystrophy\n* Rupture of EPL tendon\n\nExplanation: Amongst the given options nonunion is very rare complication because colle’s fracture occurs in cancellous area where the healing potential is very high.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nOsteochondritis of the epiphysis of the head of the femur is\n* Panner's disease\n* Kienbock's disease (Correct Answer)\n* Pehes' disease\n* Osgood Shlatter's disease\n\nExplanation: Pehes&; disease, the osteochondritis of the epiphysis of the head of the femur is the commonest osteochondritis.Maheswari 5e pg: 318\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nWhich of the following are associated with supracondylar fracture of humerus\n* It is uncommon after 15 yrs of age\n* Extension type fracture is more common than the flexion type\n* Cubitus varus deformity commonly results following malunion (Correct Answer)\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: Supracondylar fracture of humerus: Occurs most commonly in children It is an hyperextension injury It may be of flexion type or extension type Cubitus varus deformity occurs as a result of malunion. Ref: Maheshwari and Mhaskar 6e pg 97.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nTreatment of choice in newborn with club foot:\n* Observation and follow up\n* Manipulation only (Correct Answer)\n* Both manipulation and splint\n* Splint application alone\n\nExplanation: Ans: C (Both manipulation and splint) Ref: Campbell's Operative Orthopaedics, 11th editionExplanation:Components of CTEV:Ankle equinesHindfoot varusMidfoot cavusForefoot adduction.Aim of Treatment: To produce and maintain a plantigrade, supple foot that will function well.The primary treatment for CTEV is conservative.Conservative Treatment:Treatment starts within a day or two of birth.Treatment includes repeated manipulation and adhesive strapping with regular monitoring of correction by a physical therapist.Alternatively, a light plaster cast is applied with correction of the deformity and is changed every week.Order of correction of deformity:o Midfoot cavuso Forefoot adductiono Hindfoot varuso Lastly ankle equinesMnemonic for the deformities in CTEV and the order of correction of deformities: CAVE - Cavus. Adductus, Varus and Equinus.Overoorrection has to be achieved.Complication arising with incorrect manipulation - rocker- bottom deformity (arises from attempts to overcome equines before the other deformities are corrected causing a break in the foot in the midtarsal region).The universally accepted method used for serial manipulation and casting - Ponseti technique.Technique that was used previously but has fallen out of favor now - Kite technique.Difference between Ponseti and Kite techniques - During correction of deformity, in Kite technique, the center of rotation of malaligned foot (fulcrum) is on the cuboid; whereas in Ponseti technique, the fulcrum is on the head of talus.RESISTANT CASES -- Those feet that are not corrected despite &-12 weeks of serial manipulations and strapping.Operative treatment needed for resistant cases and severe, rigid deformities.Surgeries Performed for CTEV:Persistent Equinus Deformity Alone:Tendoachilles (TA) release in young infants.Tendoachilles lengthening in older children.All Components Remaining: Posteromedial Soft-Tissue Release (PMSTR)TA and tibialis posterior tendons lengthened by Z-tenotomy to correct equines and varus repectivety.Posterior capsules of ankle and subtalar joints divided to correct equines.Flexor digitorum iongus and flexor halluds longus lengthened to correct equines.Calcaneo-fibular ligament released to correct calcaneal mal rotation.Talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints released to correct forefoot adduction.Origin of intrinsic muscles and plantar fascia from the calcaneum divided to reduce any cavus or plantaris deformity.Foot is placed in a plaster cast in corrected position.LATE OR RELAPSED CLUBFOOTYoung Child (4-7 years):Revision of soft tissue releases.Shortening of the lateral side of the foot by calcaneo-cuboid fusion or cuboid enucleation (Dilwyn-Evans operation) to correct forefoot adduction.Calcaneal lateral closing wedge osteotomy to correct varus deformity.Older Child (4-11 years):Ilizarov fixator.In Above 12 Years:Triple arthrodesis (Fusion of subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints after correction of deformity).\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nWhich is the commonest fracture in children ?\n* Fracture clavicle (Correct Answer)\n* Supracondylar fracture\n* Green stick fracture of lower end of radius\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: Some guides have given option c as the answer, which is wrong. Read below :-\n\n\"Pediatric distal radius fractures are common. In fact, forearm fractures account 40% of all pediatric fractures and the distal radius and distal ulna are the most common sites within the forearm\". — Pediatric orthopedics\n\nFrom above statement, it seems that option c is the correct answer. But, this is not the case because, though, distal radius is the most common site of fracture, it is not greenstick type of fracture rather it is torus fracture :-\n\n\"Most of these distal radius fractures in children are buckle fracture, also called torus fracture\". — Pediatric orthopedics\n\nClavicle is the 2nd most common site of fracture.\nTherefore, here the best answer is clavicle\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nNerve roots involved in Klumpke's paralysis -\n* C4-5\n* C5-6\n* C6.7 (Correct Answer)\n* C8T1\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., C8T1 Klumpke's paralysiso Site of injury : Lower trunk of the brachial plexus.o Cause of injury : Undue abduction of the arm. as in clutching something with the hands after a fall from a height, or sometimes in birth injury,o Nerve roots involved : - Mainly T1 and partly C8.o Muscles paralysedIntrinsic muscles of the hand (T1).Ulnar flexors of the wrist and fingers (C8).Deformity (position of the hand). Claw hand due to the unopposed action of the long flexors and extensors of the fingers. In a claw hand there is hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the interphalangeal joints.o DisabilityClaw handCutaneous anaesthesia and analgesia in a narrow zone along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand.Homer's syndrome if T1 is injured proximal to white ramus communicans to first thoracic sympathetic ganglion. There is ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis, enophthalmos, and loss of ciliospinal reflex-may be associated. (This is because of injury to sympathetic fibres to the head and neck that leave the spinal cord through nerveT1)Vasomotor changes : The skin area with sensory loss is warmer due to arteriolar dilation. It is also drier due to the absence of sweating as there is loss of sympathetic activity.Trophic changes : Long standing case of paralysis leads to dry and scaly skin. The nails crack easily with atrophy of the pulp of fingers.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nA 10-year-old obese boy was referred to the emergency with a history of hip pain. He was observed to be limping and complained of severe pain. Which of the following investigation is not required:\n* X-ray of the hip\n* MRI of the hip (Correct Answer)\n* CT scan of hip\n* USG of hip\n\nExplanation: Order of Investigations in any inflammatory Joint Swelling X-ray | MRI | Aspiration This patient is an Obese limping child with hip pain, the possible differential diagnosis would be : Osteomyelitis (X-MAS) Septic ahritis (X-MAS) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (X-MRI) Transient synovitis (X-MAS) Hence CT will be least preferred.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nJefferson is:\n* of atlas (Correct Answer)\n* axis\n* of spinous process of C 7\n* of any cervical vertebra\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' ie of Atlas Some common named fractures :Jefferson *-Burst of atlas *Hangman's *- of axis *Clayshovellers *-Spines process of C7 * Smiths *-Reverse of colie's * ( at the cortico cancellus junction of radius with volar tilt of the distal fragment)* Barton 's *-distal radius ( extends from the distal articular surface of the radius to either its ant. or post, cortices)* Monteggia's dislocation*- of proximal half of ulna with dislocation of head of the radius* Galeazzi dislocation *- of the distal half of radius with dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint* Chauffer's*-radial styloid process* Aviator's *- neck of talus* Bennett's *- base of first metacarpal intraarticular* Rolando *- base of first metacarpal, extraarticular* Night stick *-Isolated shaft of ulna* Bumper *-comminuted of lateral condyle of tibia* Cotton's-trimalleolar ankle * Pott's *-bimalleolar ankle * March *-stress of shaft of 2nd metatarsal* Jone 's - of the base of the 5th metatarsal\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nHallux valgus is associated with all except -\n* An exostosis on the medial side of the head of the first metatarsal (Correct Answer)\n* A bunion\n* Osteoarthritis of the metatarsophalangeal joint\n* Over- riding or under- riding of the second toe by the third\n\nExplanation: Hallux valgus \n\nHallux valgus is lateral (outward) deviation of great toe at the metatarsophalangeal joint.\nIt is the commonest foot deformity.\nIt is common in women past middle age and is not infrequent even in young women.\nCommon causes are :\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\nWearing pointed shoes with high heels\nHereditary factors\nIdiopathic\n\nPathology\n\nOutward deviation of the great toe.\nMedially deviated head of the first metatarsal, causing an unduly wide gap between 1st & 2nd metatarsal heads (metatarsus primus varus).\nAfter several years two secondary changes occur:-\n\n\nFormation of a thick-walled bursa (bunion) over the medial prominence of 1\" metatarsal head.\nOsteoarthritis of the metatarsophalangeal joint.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that medial prominence over metatarsal head looks like an exostosis, but there is no true exostosis. (Apley's 9th/e 603)\nLateral deviation of great toe causes overcrowding of lateral toes and sometimes overriding of adjacent toes.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nRing sequestrum is seen in -\n* Typhoid osteomyelitis\n* Chronic osteomyelitis (Correct Answer)\n* Amputation stump\n* Tuberculosis osteomyelitis\n\nExplanation: Excessive periosteal stripping during amputation may result in ring sequestrum in amputation stump.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nFemoral neck fracture of 4-week-old in an young adult should be best by treated one of the following:\n* Total hip replacement (Correct Answer)\n* Reduction of fracture and femoral osteotomy with fixation\n* Prosthetic replacement of femoral head\n* Reduction of fracture and multiple screw fixation\n\nExplanation: (b) Reduction of fracture and femoral osteotomy with fixation- >3 weeks fracture in <65 years age group-reduction and fixation along with Osteotomy/Bone grafting.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nJoint not involved in Rheumatoid ahritis according to 1987 ACR CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA ?\n* Knee\n* Ankle (Correct Answer)\n* Tarsometatarsal\n* Metatarsophalangeal\n\nExplanation: ref : maheswari 9th ed\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nOsteoclastoma arises from which pa of bone?\n* Epiphysis (Correct Answer)\n* Metaphysis\n* Diaphysis\n* All the above\n\nExplanation: OSTEOCLASTOMA (GIANT CELL TUMOUR) Giant cell tumour (GCT) is a common bone tumour with variable growth potential. Though generally classified as benign*, it tends to recur after local removal. The tumour is seen commonly in the age group of 20-40 years i.e., after epiphyseal fusion. The bones affected commonly are those around the knee i.e., lower-end of the femur and upper-end of the tibia. Lower-end of the radius is another common site. The tumour is located at the epiphysis**. It often reaches almost up to the joint surface. Common presenting complaints are swelling and vague pain Reference: Maheshwari; Essential Ohopaedics; Page no: 237\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\n13, years old boy, LEAST common cause of proximal lytic lesion of head of femur is:\n* Plasmacytoma (Correct Answer)\n* Metastasis\n* Histiocytosis\n* Bone tumour\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' Plasmacytoma If multiple myeloma occurs as a solitary lesion it is K/a PlasmacytomaAge gp is 6th-7th decade, Rare before 40yrs of ageSo the lytic lesion in a 13yrs old boy cannot be a plasmacytoma\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nMost common complication of scaphoid fracture is\n* Malunion (Correct Answer)\n* Avascular necrosis\n* Wrist stiffners\n* Ahritis\n\nExplanation: Scaphoid Fractures * The scaphoid is the most frequently fractured carpal bone, accounting for 71% of all carpal bone fractures. * Scaphoid fractures often occur in young and middle-aged adults, typically those aged 15-60 years. * About 5-12% of scaphoid fractures are associated with other fractures * 70-80% occur at the waist or mid-poion * 10-20% proximal pole Management # Proximal pole -- Depends on size and vascularity of fracture -- Growing sentiment that most should be treated operatively because of high propensity for non-union and increased duration of immobilisation required for non-operative management -- If large enough to accommodate a screw than every attempt should be made Complication * Malunion -- Malunion may lead to limited motion about the wrist, decreased grip strength, and pain. -- The most frequent pattern of malunion is persistent angular deformity, or the humpback deformity. -- Malunion usually can be treated with osteotomy and bone grafting to correct angular deformity and length. * Literature confusing with no comparative studies to document improvement in hand function * Delayed union and non-union -- Delayed union is incomplete union after 4 months of cast immobilization. -- Non-union is an unhealed fracture with smooth fibrocailage covering the fracture site. -- About 10-15% of all scaphoid fractures do not unite. -- Some degree of delayed union or non-union occurs in nearly all proximal pole fractures and in 30% of scaphoid waist fractures # Delayed union is anticipated if fracture treatment is delayed for several weeks. # The risk of non-union increases after a delay of 4 weeks. * These delays may be related to the patient&;s failure to seek treatment for a presumed sprain, but they more frequently are related to improper or incomplete immobilization or a failure to diagnose and treat the acute fracture ref : maheswari 9th ed\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nSite for 1st order bone grafting -\n* Pelvis (Correct Answer)\n* Tibial metaphysis\n* Medial malleolus\n* Femoral condyle\n\nExplanation: Option a, b, c, d & e all can be used as a source of bone graft.\nHowever, most common and primary source of bone graft is iliac crest of pelvis.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nNot a complication of Acute osteomyelitis\n* Chronic osteomyelitis\n* Septicemia\n* Recurrence (Correct Answer)\n* Osteoclastoma\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nNon-union is common in fracture of\n* Scapula\n* Talus (Correct Answer)\n* Neck of femur\n* Tibial fracture\n\nExplanation: The following are some of the clinical findings which suggest delayed union and non union : Persistent pain Pain on stressing the fracture Mobility (in non-union) Increasing deformity at the fracture site (in non-union). Ref essential ohopaedic maheshwari and mhaskar 9TH ED p 48\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nA 50-year-old man presented with multiple pathological fractures. His serum calcium was 11.5 mg/dl and phosphate was 2.5 mg/dl. Alkaline phosphatase was 940 I.U./dl. The most probable diagnosis is -\n* Osteoporosis\n* Osteomalacia\n* Multiple myeloma (Correct Answer)\n* Hyperparathyroidism\n\nExplanation: Multiple pathological fractures, high calcium, low phosphate and high alkaline phosphatase suggest the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nWhich of the following is a primary defect in Paget's disease?\n* Osteoblast (Correct Answer)\n* Osteoclast\n* Osteocyte\n* Fibroblast\n\nExplanation: Paget's disease (Osteitis deformans)\n\nPaget's disease is characterized by increased bone turnover and enlargement and thickening of the bone, but the internal architecture is abnormal and the bone is usually brittle.\nPrimary defect is in osteoclasts with increased osteoclastic activity.\nThis results secondarily increase in osteoblastic activity (normal osteoclasts and osteoblasts act in a co-ordinated manner).\nSo, characteristic cellular change is a marked increase in osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity.\nBone turnover is accelerated, plasma alkaline phosphatase is raised (a sign of osteoblastic activity) and there is increased excretion of hydroxyproline in urine (due to osteoclastic activity).\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\n\"Wind-swept deformity\" is seen in:\n* Ankylosing spondylitis\n* Scurvy\n* Rheumatoid ahritis (Correct Answer)\n* Rickets\n\nExplanation: Rickets >Rheumatoid Ahritis Wind swept deformity is classically used for knee deformity of rickets Windswept deformity. 1. Knee: A valgus deformity of one knee in association of varus deformity of other knee is known as windswept deformity. It is seen in: rickets, hereditary dysplasia (epiphyseal dysplasia) of bone and rheumatoid ahritis. 2. Foot: Detion of all--toes in one direction (usually laterally) is known as windswept deformity. It is seen in rheumatoid ahritis. 3. Hand: Detion of all fingers (usually medially) is known as windswept deformity. It is seen in rheumatoid ahritis. Coming to the question here we have to choose one and this terminology is classically for rickets knee deformity.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nA young woman, 30 years old complains of pain in the left knee joint which increases after exercise since 4 months. An X-ray shows eccentric bone cyst. The likely diagnosis is:\n* Aneurysmal bone cyst (Correct Answer)\n* Unicameral bone cyst\n* Hydatid cyst\n* Fibrous dysplasia.\n\nExplanation: Ans: A (Aneurysmal bone cyst) Ref: Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures, 9th edition - TumoursExplanation:Aneurysmal Bone CystIt may be encountered at any age and in almost any bone, though more often in young adults and in the long-bone metaphyses.Usually it arises spontaneously but it may appear after degeneration or haemorrhage in some other lesion.With expanding lesions, patients may complain of pain.Occasionally, a large cyst may cause a visible or palpable swelling of the bone.X-rays show a well-defined radiolucent cyst, often trabeeulated and eccentrically placed.In a growing tubular bone it is always situated in the metaphysis and therefore may resemble a simple cyst or one of the other cyst-like lesions.Occasional sites include vertebrae and the flat bones.In an adult an aneurysmal bone cyst may be mistaken for a giant-cell tumour.Unicameral Bone CystAlso called as simple bone cyst, appears during childhood, typically in the metaphysis of one of the long bones and most commonly in the proximal humerus or femur.It is not a tumour, it tends to heal spontaneously and it is seldom seen in adults.The condition is usually discovered after a pathological fracture or as an incidental finding on X-ray.X-rays show a well-demarcated radiolucent area in the metaphysis, often extending up to the phvseal plate; the cortex may be thinned and the bone expanded.Hydatid CystIt is disease, is caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus.Parasitic infestation is common among sheep farmers, but bone lesions are rare.The bones most commonly affected are the vertebrae, pelvis, femur, scapula and ribs.The patient may complain of pain and swelling, or may present for the first time with a pathological fracture or compression of the spinal cord.Infestation sometimes starts in childhood but the cysts take so long to enlarge that clinical symptom and signs may not become apparent for many years.X-rays show solitary or nudtiloculated hone cysts, hut only moderate expansion of the cortices. However, cortical thinning may lead to a pathological fracture.In the spine, hydatid disease may involve adjacent vertebrae, with large cysts extending into the paravertebral soft tissues.These features are best seen on CT and MRI, which should always be performed if operative excision of the lesion is contemplated.Fibrous DysplasiaIt is developmental disorders in which areas of trabecular bone are replaced by cellular fibrous tissue containing Hecks of osteoid and woven bone.It may affect one bone (monostotic) one limb (monomelic) or many bones (polyostotic).If the lesions are large, the bone is considerably weakened and pathological fractures or progressive deformity may occur.The most common sites of occurrence are the proximal femur, tibia, humerus, ribs and craniofacial bones.Small, single lesions are asymptomatic.Large, monostotic lesions may cause pain or maybe discovered only when the patient develops a pathological fracture.Patients with polyostotic disease present in childhood or adolescence with pain, limp, bony enlargement, deformity or pathological fracture.Untreated, the characteristic deformities persist through adult life.Occasionally the bone disorder is associated with cafe-au-Iait patches on the skin and (in girls) precocious sexual development (Albright's syndrome).X-rays show radiolucent 'cystic' areas in the metaphysis or shaft; because they contain fibrous tissue with diffuse spots of immature bone, the lucent patches typically have a slightly hazy or 'ground-glass' appearance.The weight bearing bones may be bent, and one of the classic features is the 'shepherd's crook' deformity of the proximal femur.Radioscintigraphy shows marked activity in the lesion.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nClergyman's knee is?\n* Pre patellar bursitis (Correct Answer)\n* Infra patellar bursitis\n* Supra patellar bursitis\n* Pre anserine bursitis\n\nExplanation: ANSWER: (B) Infra patellar bursitisREF: Keith L Moore 4th ed page 394, Review of Orthopaedics 6th ed by Mark D. Miller, Stephen R. Thompson, Jennifer Hart page 308Indirect repeat Orthopedics 2012 Session 1Infrapatellar bursitis is the inflammation of the infrapatellar bursa, wdiich is located just below the kneecap. It is a common cause of knee pain and swelling among persons whose work involves kneeling on hard surfaces. Depending on the occupation affected it is known by a variety nicknames, most commonly floor layers' knee, but also plumbers' knee, clergyman's knee\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nWhich of the following statement is not true about Coxa Plana:\n* Occur more commonly in females (Correct Answer)\n* Commonly affect children in first decade\n* Abduction in flexion is restricted\n* Lateral subluxation of femoral head on x-rays\n\nExplanation: Ans. A. Occurs more commonly in females.* Coxa plana is pert he's disease. It is osteonecrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis in a growing child caused by poorly understood factors. It affects male > females during first decade of life.* Most common symptom is limp. During early phase, joint is irritable so extremes of all the movements are restricted and painful.* Later, most movements are full but abduction, especially in flexion is almost always limited. When hip is flexed, it goes into ER.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nSprengel's shoulder is due to deformity -\n* Scapula (Correct Answer)\n* Humerus\n* Clavicle\n* Vertebra\n\nExplanation: Congenital high scanula (sprengers shoulder) \n\nCongenital high scapula is an uncommon congenital deformity characterized by an abnormally high position and relative fixity of scapula.\nThe anomaly represents a failure of the scapula to descend during development to its normal thoracic position.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nCommonest site of tuberculosis is:\n* Hip joint (Correct Answer)\n* Spine\n* Knee joint\n* Ankle joint\n\nExplanation: (Spine): Ref: 387-A* The spine is the most common site of skeletal tuberculosis and the most dangerous* Blood borne infection usually settles in a vertebral body adjacent to the intervertebral disc. Bone destruction and caseation follows, with infection spreading to the disc spaces and to the adjacent vertebrae. As the vertebral bodies collapse into each other, a sharp angulation (or kyphos) develops. Caseation and cold abscess formation may extend to neighbouring vertebrae or escape into the paravertebral soft tissues. There is a major risk of cord damage due to pressure by the abscess or displaced bone or ischaemia from spinal artery thrombosis.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nGold standard diagnostic method for guiding antibiotic therapy in a case of osteomyelitis is ____:\n* Blood culture (Correct Answer)\n* Bone biopsy\n* Wound swab\n* Sinus tract culture\n\nExplanation: Ans. B. Bone biopsyBone biopsy is the gold standard method for guiding antibiotic therapy in case of osteomyelitis.Wound swab is not a definitive method to confirm the origin of bacterial infection because the organism need not necessarily contaminate the wound. Similarly, a negative sinus tract culture also does not rule out the possibility of an infection on the inside as it is not essential for the organism to travel up to the surface.A blood culture may be used to guide antibiotic therapy for hematologically acquired osteomyelitis but the gold standard investigation always remains a bone biopsy.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nTrue about nerve injuries among following are:\n* Froment sign seen in median nerve palsy is due to Flexor pollicis longus action\n* Waenburg sign is seen in median nerve palsy (Correct Answer)\n* Median nerve is also named as labourer's nerve\n* All lumbricals are supplied by median nerve\n\nExplanation: Froment sign (Fig a-normal, b- positive) Seen in ulnar nerve palsy due to action of FPL which is supplied by median nerve. Waenberg sign (c- normal, d- positive) Seen in ulnar nerve palsy and not median nerve palsy so this option is wrong. It is caused by an unopposed action of the ulnar inseion of the extensor digiti minimi(radial nerve innervation). It occurs due to paralysis of the palmar interosseous muscle that abducts the little finger. Only lateral two lumbricals are supplied by median nerve medial two lumbricals are supplied by ulnar nerve.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nWhich of the following is not true regarding in- flammatory arthritis -\n* Presence of morning stiffness (Correct Answer)\n* Sclerosis on X-ray\n* Anemia of chronic disease\n* Presence of fever, weight loss and elevated ESR\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., Sclerosis on X ray* Inflammatory arthritis refers to those conditions of the joints that involve the immune system and cause inflammation. Inflammatory arthritis are :-# RA# Reiter's syndrome# Gout & Pseudogout# Reactive arthritis# Ankylosing spondylitis# Psoriatic arthritis# Lupus arthritis Features of inflammatory arthritisa) Presence of some or all four cardinal signs of inflammation.i) Erythemaii) Painiii) Warmthiv) Swellingb) Systemic symptomsi) Prolonged morning stiffness, often lasting for several hours.

Maheshwari ortho 3rd/pg. 112; Current Ortho/ Ch.3.)Femoral Neck FractureIntroduction:# There are two types of of the neck of femur .Intracapsular &Extracapsular# Most of the Femoral neck fractures are intracapsular fractures (as a matter of convention, the term fracture of the neck of femur' is used for intracapsular fracture of the neck).# The extracapsular are usually called inter-trochanteric .Classification# A. Anatomical classification# B. Pauwel's classification# C. Garden's classificationGarden classification for acute fractures of femoral neck is the most widely used system:Garden classification for fractures of femoral neckType 1Valgus impaction of the femoral headType 2Complete but nondisplacedType 3Complete fracture, displaced less than 50%Type 4Complete fracture displaced greater than 50%c/f:# The involved extremity may be slightly shortened and externally rotated.# Tenderness in groin# Attempted hip movements painful, and asso with sever spasm# Active straight leg rising not possible.Complications:# 1. Non-union (in 30-40% of IC ).# 2. AVN: high risk of nonunion or avascular necrosis of the femoral head due the unusual vascularization of the femoral head and neck. The incidence of avascular necrosis increases with the amount of fracture displacement and the amount of time before the fracture is reduced.# 3. OARx:# This is rightly termed as \"unsolved \" because of the high incidence of complications.# This invariable needs operative Rx.# An impacted fracture is Rxed conservatively in all age groups (hip spica in childen and Thomas splint in adults).# Unimpacted or displaced fracture:- < 60 yrs: internal fixation.- > 60 yrs: head excised and replaced by prosthesis done as a primary procedure.- In few younger patients, especially if preesenting late, open reduction of is done.- Internal fixation can be done using any of the following implant:# Multiple cancellous screws - most commonly used.# Dynamic hip screws (DHS)# Multiple Knowle's pins/More's pins - used in children.# SP nail - not popular now.- At some centres in general an inter-trochanteric osteotomy (McMurray's osteotomy is preferred).- Hemiarthroplasty is used for elderly patients & Austin Moore prosthesis is used most commonly. This cannot be used as a method of Rx in younger patients as prosthesis becomes loose over a period of time (8-10 yrs).Meyer's procedure ( reduced by exposing it from behind and it is fixed with multiple screws and supplemented with vascularised muscle pedicle bone graft). It is used in treating the fractures presenting late and those with significant communition. It is also used for non-union of the femoral neck .Additional Educational points:The vascular supply of the femoral head is also of paramount importance. There are three main sources of vascular supply:1) The retinacular vessels arising from the lateral femoral circumflex artery and the inferior metaphyseal artery and then running beneath the synovium along the neck, which they penetrate proximally both anteriorly and posteriorly;2) The interosseous circulation crossing the marrow spaces from distal to proximal; and3) Unreliably, the ligamentum teres artery.\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nTennis elbow is characterized by -\n* Tenderness over the medial epicondyle (Correct Answer)\n* Tendinits of common extensor origin\n* Tendinitis of common flexor origin\n* Painful flexion and extension\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., Tendinits of common extensor origin o Tennis elbow is extraarticular affection characterized by pain and acute tenderness at the origin of the extensor muscles of the forearm from the lateral epicondyle.o It is believed to be caused by strain of the forearm extensor muscles, particularly the extensor carpi radialishrevis, at the point of their origin from lateral epicondyle,\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nNerve injured in subcoracoid dislocation of humerus  is\n* Axillary nerve (Correct Answer)\n* Radial nerve\n* Brochial plexus\n* Median nerve\n\n## Question from Orthopaedics:\nIschial bursitis is also known as -\n* Clergyman's knee\n* Housemaid's knee (Correct Answer)\n* Weaver's bottom\n* Student's elbow\n\nExplanation: COMMON BURSITIS: *Ischial bursitis- Weaver&;s bottom *prepatellar bursitis- House maid&;s knee * Olecranon bursitis- Student&;s elbow * On lateral malleolus- Tailor&;s ankle *On great toe- Bunion.

Some cases of DCIS have a single growth pattern, but most are comprised of a mixture of patterns. Nuclear grade and necrosis are better predictors of local recurrence and progression to invasion than architectural type. Comedo DCIS may occasionally produce vague nodularity, but more often it is detected on mammography as clustered or linear and branching areas of calcification (Fig. 23-17A). It is defined by two features: (1) tumor cells with pleomorphic, high- grade nuclei and (2) areas of central necrosis (Fig. 23-17B). Noncomedo DCIS lacks either high-grade nuclei or central necrosis. Several patterns may be seen. Cribriform DCIS may have rounded (cookie cutter-like) spaces (Fig. 23-17C) within the ducts, or a solid DCIS pattern. Micropapillary DCIS pro- duces bulbous protrusions without a fibrovascular core, often arranged in complex intraductal patterns (Fig. 23-17D). In other cases, DCIS produces true papillae with fibrovascular cores that lack a myoepithelial cell layer. Calcifications may also be seen in noncomedo forms of DCIS in association with focal necrosis or intraluminal secretions.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nThe role played by MHC proteins is to -\n* Transduce the signal to T cells following antigen recognition\n* Mediate immunoglobulin class - switching (Correct Answer)\n* Present antigens for recognition by T cell antigen receptors\n* Enhance the secretion of cytokines\n\nExplanation: .

This heterodimer binds to DNA sequences in target genes and is a potent transcriptional activator.\nThe range of activities attributed to MYC includes histone acetylation, reduced cell adhesion and increased cell motility, increased protein synthesis, and decreased proteinase activity.\nThe MYC protooncogene contains separate sequences that encode the growth promoting and apoptotic activities.\nIn contrast to the regulated expression of MYC during normal cell proliferation, persistent expression, and in some cases overexpression, of the MYC protein is commonly found in tumors.\nThis may lead to sustained transcription of critical target genes and subsequent neoplastic transformation.\nDysregulation of MYC expression resulting from translocation of the gene occurs in Burkitt lymphoma.\nMYC is amplified in some cases of breast, colon, lung, and many other carcinomas. The related N-MYC and L-MYC genes are amplified in neuroblastomas and small cell cancers of the lung, respectively.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nAll are true about Turner syndrome except\n* Sho stature\n* Webbed neck\n* Dysgenetic gonads (Correct Answer)\n* True hermaphrodism\n\nExplanation: Turner syndrome, characterized by primary hypogonadism in phenotypic females, results from paial or complete monosomy of the sho arm of the X chromosome. Turner syndrome include Significant growth retardation, leading to abnormally sho stature (below the third percentile); swelling of the nape of the neck due to distended lymphatic channels (in infancy) that is seen as webbing of the neck in older children; low posterior hairline; cubitus valgus (an increase in the carrying angle of the arms); shieldlike chest with widely spaced nipples; high-arched palate; lymphedema of the hands and feet; a variety of congenital malformations such as horseshoe kidney, bicuspid aoic valve, and coarctation of the aoa. Cardiovascular abnormalities are the most common cause of death in childhood. In adolescence, affected girls fail to develop normal secondary sex characteristics; the genitalia remain infantile, breast development is minimal, little pubic hair appears. Most patients have primary amenorrhea, transformation of the ovaries into white streaks of fibrous stroma devoid of follicles. The mental status is normal (Robbins Basic Pathology,9th edition,pg no. 240)\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nWhat accumulates in tissues in hemochromatosis?\n* Iron (Correct Answer)\n* Copper\n* Ceruloplasmin\n* Lipofuschhin\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Iron Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. Hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron metabolism. Characterized by a triad of :- Micronodular cirrhosis Diabetes mellitus Skin pigmentation Organ not showing iron deposition in hemochromatosis Testis\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nGenetic polymorphism include -a)  SNPb)  Microsatellitesc)  Mutationsd)  Translocation e) Mini satellites\n* abe (Correct Answer)\n* bcd\n* cde\n* acd\n\nExplanation: Genetic polymorphism \n\nThe occurrence of different DNA sequence in at least 1% of population, i.e. presence of more than one genetically distinct types in single population of a species.\nIn very simple words, genetic polymorphism causes diversity between individuals, e.g. genetic polymorphism might give rise to blue eyes versus brown eyes, or straight hair versus curly hair.\nIt should be noted that in genetic polymorphism there is variability in DNA sequence; However, the individuals are normal (not diseased); and this differentiate genetic polymorphism from mutation. The, term \"mutation\", as opposed to \"polymorphism\", is generally used to refer to changes in DNA sequence which have been associated with disease (or a risk of disease) and are not present in most individuals of a species (present in less than 0.5-1% of individuals, in contrast to genetic polymorphism).\nTwo types of genetic polymorphisms are there:\n\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) → as the name suggest there is variation in a single nucleotide in every stretch of approximately 1000 base pairs.\nRepeat-length Polymorphism → In contrast to SNPs there are short repetitive sequences of variation:\n\n\nMicrosatellites → Repeat size of 2-6 base pairs and less than 1 kilobase.\nMinisatellites → 15 to 70 base pairs and 1-3 kilobase.\n\n\nMost common type of polymorphism is single nucleotide polymorphis (SNP).\nThese types of base substitutions are frequently encountered during genetic testing and should be differentiated from true mutation that alter protein expression.\nThe best example of genetic polymorphism is blood groups.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nMost common site for leiomyoma in GIT ?\n* Appendix\n* Jejunum\n* Ileum (Correct Answer)\n* Stomach\n\nExplanation: Stomach is the most common site for leiomyoma in GIT.\nMost common benign tumor of oesophagus is stomach.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nAlkaline phosphatase levels are elevated in all of the following except -\n* Brain tumors (Correct Answer)\n* Obstructive jaundice\n* Bone tumors\n* Placental tumors\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nTrue statements about renal cell carcinoma except?\n* Asbestos, sickle cell anemia & petroleum products are risk factors\n* Clear cell cancer arise from proximal convoluted tubule\n* Cannon ball metastasis (Correct Answer)\n* Bellini duct cancer arise from loop of henle.\n\nExplanation: Bellini duct cancer arise from the collecting duct cells in medulla & not the Loop of Henle. Risk factors of Renal Cell Carcinoma : Cigarette smokers have double the incidence of renal cell carcinoma Tobacco HTN /obesity/estrogen Asbestos Sickle cell anemia Petroleum products Clear cell carcinoma arises from Proximal convoluted Tubule. Cannon ball opacities on chest x-ray suggest metastatic malignancies such as choriocarcinoma, lung carcinoma, renal cell cancer, or endometrial carcinoma.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nHLA marker of bechet's syndrome -\n* HLA-B27\n* HLA-DR5 (Correct Answer)\n* HLA-B51\n* HLA-CW6\n\nExplanation: Behcet's disease, or Behcet's syndrome, is a rare and poorly understood condition that results in inflammation of the blood vessels and tissues. Confirming a diagnosis of Behcet's disease can be difficult because the symptoms are so wide-ranging and general (they can be shared with a number of other conditions)The main symptoms of Behcet's disease include: genital and mouth ulcers red, painful eyes and blurred vision acne-like spots headaches painful, stiff and swollen joints In severe cases, there's also a risk of serious and potentially life-threatening problems, such as permanent vision loss and strokes. Most people with the condition experience episodes where their symptoms are severe (flare-ups or relapses), followed by periods where the symptoms disappear (remission). Over time, some of the symptoms can settle down and become less troublesome, although they may never resolve completely.HLA-B51 (B51) is an HLA-B serotype. The serotype identifies the more common HLA-B*51 gene products. B51 is a split antigen of the broad antigen B5, and is a sister serotype of B52. There are a large number of alleles within the B*51 allele group. B51 is associated with several diseases, including Behcet's disease.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nA hair on end appearance of the skull is seen in all of the following expect\n* Thalassemia\n* Sickle anemia\n* Cooley's anaemia (Correct Answer)\n* Pagets disease\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nMost important for diapedesis\n* PECAM (Correct Answer)\n* Selectin\n* Integrin\n* Mucin like Glycoprotein\n\nExplanation: Diapedesis or Transmigration-process of leukocyte recruitment is migration of the leukocytes through the endothelium.\n\nMost important for diapedesis is PECAM- 1 and CD31 molecules\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nThe gene responsible for folic acid transpo is situated on which chromosome-\n* 10\n* 5\n* X (Correct Answer)\n* 21\n\nExplanation: Folate transpoer 1 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the SLC19A1 gene. pteroylglutamic acid) into, out of or within a cell, or between cells, by means of some agent such as a transpoer or pore.

C i.e. Serotonin Carcinoid syndrome It refers to the array of symptoms that occur secondary to carcinoid tumors. The syndrome includes flushing and diarrhea, and, less frequently,hea failure and bronchoconstriction. It is caused by endogenous secretion of mainly serotonin and kallikrein.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nA 25-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presents with diffuse petechiae and fatigue. Physical examination demonstrates lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly Laboratory findings include normocytic anemia (hemoglobin =6.1 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (30,000/mL). Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism in the development of thrombocytopenia in this patient?\n* Antibody-mediated platelet destruction (Correct Answer)\n* Clonal plasma cell circulating paraprotein\n* Decreased susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis\n* Defect in the platelet cytoskeleton\n\nExplanation: In common with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and certain drug-induced thrombocytopenias, systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with increased platelet destruction due to immune-mediated damage and removal of circulating platelets (antibody-mediated platelet destruction). The other choices do not represent immune destruction of platelets.Diagnosis: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, systemiclupus erythematosus\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nIn which of the following conditions uniform dilation of esophagus is seen\n* Scleroderma\n* Trypanosoma cruzi infection\n* Dermatomysitis (Correct Answer)\n* BD\n\nExplanation: In Trypanosoma cruzi infection& dermatomyositis uniform dilatation of oesophagus is seen Esophageal dilatation is a therapeutic endoscopic procedure that enlarges the lumen of the esophagus. ...Complications of esophageal dilatation include the following: Odynophagia, or painful swallowing. Hematemesis, or bloody vomit. Esophageal perforation. Mediastinitis.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nCharacteristic pathological feature of Parkinson's disease is presence of -\n* Lewy bodies (Correct Answer)\n* Babes nodule\n* Neuro fibrillary tangle\n* Negri-bodies\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Lewy Bodies Pathologic Examiniation in Parkinsons shows : Gross / Macroscopically : Pallor of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus o Microscopic Examination : 1. Loss of catecholaminergic neurons in these regions + gliosis 2. Lewy bodies. o Lewy Bodies :are inclusion bodies found within neurons in Parkinsons disease. o Lewy bodies are single or multiple, intra-cytoplasmic, cosinophilic, round and elongated inclusions that often have a dense core surrounded by a pale halo. Ultrastructurally :These are composed of fine filaments, densely packed in the core but loose at the rim.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nA 35-year-old man with Down syndrome dies of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Gross examination of the patient's brain at autopsy shows mild microcephaly and underdevelopment of the superior temporal gyri. Histologic examination would most likely show which of the following neuropathologic changes?\n* AA amyloidosis\n* Lewy bodies\n* Negri bodies (Correct Answer)\n* Neurofibrillary tangles\n\nExplanation: One of the most intriguing neurologic features of Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is its association with Alzheimer disease. The morphologic lesions characteristic of Alzheimer disease progress in all patients with Down syndrome and are universally demonstrable by age 35 years. These changes include granulovacuolar degeneration, neurofibrillary tangles, senile (neuritic) plaques, and loss of neurons. The gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP) is located on chromosome 21, and the additional dose of the gene product in patients with trisomy 21 may predispose to precocious accumulation of Ab. Some patients with the familial form of Alzheimer disease harbor mutations in APP or presenilin genes. These mutations lead to increased production of Ab--the amyloidogenic fragment of APP. None of the other choices are associated with the pathogenesis of Down syndrome or Alzheimer disease.Diagnosis: Down syndrome, amyloidosis\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nAll of the following are true regarding Down's Syndrome EXCEPT;\n* Only found in female (Correct Answer)\n* Simian crease\n* Growth retardation\n* Epicanthus with oblique palpebral fissure\n\nExplanation: Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21): Mental retardation Epicanthic folds and flat facial profile Simian's crease Umblical hernia Hypotonia Gap between first and second toe Congenital hea defects\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nMost important role in apoptosis by\n* SER\n* Golgi complex (Correct Answer)\n* Mitochondria\n* RER\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nWhich of the following is not compatible with a diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia?\n* Peripheral blood monocytosis, more than 1 x 107L\n* Increased Hemoglobin F levels for age (Correct Answer)\n* Presence of bcr/abl fusion gene\n* GM - CSF hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitors in vitro\n\nExplanation: .

Nerve conduction studies show findings consistent with demyelination and remyelination. He is treated with plasmapheresis. Which of the following disorders is most likely to cause this man's neurologic disease?\n* Bacterial infection\n* Carcinoma\n* Hyperglycemia (Correct Answer)\n* Immune dysregulation\n\nExplanation: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) can be seen in patients with immunologic diseases. Treatment may aid recovery, but a chronic course may ensue. Bacterial infections produce signs of acute inflammation with redness and swelling and tend not to involve nerves specifically. Some paraneoplastic syndromes may occur with carcinomas, such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, with weakness. Carcinomas are less likely at this age and are not frequent complications of HIV infection. Hyperglycemia is characteristic of diabetes mellitus, and diabetic neuropathy is likely to be progressive and unremitting. Traumatic injury is unlikely to produce such widespread findings and unlikely to be followed by a variable course.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nA Person suffers from HLA B 27 associated reactive ahritis, urethritis and conjunctivitis. Which is most likely organism involved in this case ?\n* Borrelia burgdorferi (Correct Answer)\n* Ureaplasma urealyticum\n* Betahemolytic streptococci\n* Streptococcus bovis\n\nExplanation: Ureaplasma urealyticum\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nA 75-year-old man has a history of transient attacks of loss of vision. The only abnormalities on physical examination are bruits over the carotids in the neck. Two days later he suddenly becomes hemiplegic and loses consciousness. He is rushed to the emergency room and a CT scan shows evidence of cerebral infarction. He is put on life support but dies 5 days later. At autopsy, there is an area of necrosis and microscopically these lesions are noted to have increased numbers of cells distributed around the central zone of necrosis. Which of the following cell types is most likely to have a phagocytic function in these lesions?\n* Arachnoidal cells\n* Astrocytes\n* Ependymal cells (Correct Answer)\n* Microglia\n\nExplanation: Microglial cells are part of the body's fixed macrophage system, derived originally from mesoderm. Microglia can respond to cerebral injuries by taking on a macrophage-like function. The arachnoid layer is part of the meninges covering the brain. Astrocytes can proliferate in response to brain injuries, a process called gliosis, but there is no phagocytosis. Ependymal cells line the ventricular system containing CSF. Oligodendroglial cells provide the myelin sheaths for neuronal axons in the CNS.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nIn TTP, all of the following are seen except: March 2011\n* Renal failure\n* Hemolyic anemia (Correct Answer)\n* Thrombocytosis\n* Neurological features\n\nExplanation: Ans. C: Thrombocytosis According to its original description, TTP was defined as the pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, transient neurological deficits, and renal failure. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/TTP/Moschcowitz syndrome It is a rare disorder cauing extensive microscopic thromboses to form in small blood vessels throughout the body (thrombotic microangiopathy). Most cases of TTP arise from inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving large multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) into smaller units. A rarer form of TTP, called Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, is genetically inherited as a dysfunction of ADAMTS13. If large vWF multimers persist there is tendency for increased coagulation. Red blood cells passing the microscopic clots are subjected to shear stress which damages their membranes, leading to intravascular hemolysis and schistocyte formation. Reduced blood flow due to thrombosis and cellular injury results in end organ damage. Current therapy is based on suppo and plasmapheresis to reduce circulating antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenish blood levels of the enzyme Classically, the following five features (\"pentad\") are indicative of TTP: - Neurologic symptoms (fluctuating), such as hallucinations, bizarre behavior, altered mental status, stroke or headaches - Kidney failure - Fever - Thrombocytopenia, leading to bruising or purpura - Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (anemia, jaundice and a blood film featuring evidence of mechanical fragmentation of red blood cells)\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nWhich of the following drugs is not effective in case of Trigeminat Neuralgia?\n* Carbamazipine (Correct Answer)\n* acetaminophen\n* Phenytoin sodium\n* Baclofen\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nPatients has G6PD deficiency often have an increased susceptibility to infection, which in turn may precipitate a hemolytic episode. What is the most likely underlying mechanism for the increased risk of infection?\n* Decreased amount of glutathione in the white blood cells (Correct Answer)\n* Decreased amount of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in the white blood cells\n* Defective phagocytosis\n* Deficiency of myeloperoxidase\n\nExplanation: Acute hemolytic episodes in patients with glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are most commonly precipitated by infection. Increased susceptibility to infection in these patients is related to a decrease in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) synthesis in neurophil s and monocytes. NADPH is an essential component of the oxygen-dependent myeloperoxidase system, an impoant means of eliminating bacteria. NADPH acts with NADPH oxidase to conve molecular oxygen into a superoxide free radical, generating the respiratory burst responsible for the destruction of bacteria. Absence of NADPH, as a result of G6PD deficiency, interferes with this impoant bactericidal mechanism, thus rendering the patient susceptible to infection.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nIn thymus, which gene is responsible for recognition of self-antigens?\n* NOTCH 1 (Correct Answer)\n* AIRE\n* Rb\n* PTEN\n\nExplanation: Immunologic tolerance is the phenomenon of unresponsiveness to an antigen induced by exposure of lymphocytes to that antigen. A protein called AIRE (autoimmune regulator) stimulates expression of some \"peripheral tissue-restricted\" self-antigens in the thymus It is critical for deletion or negative selection of immature T cells specific for these antigens. Mutations in the AIRE gene are the cause of an autoimmune polyendocrinopathy. In the CD4+ T-cell lineage, some of the cells that see self-antigens in the thymus do not die but develop into regulatory T cells.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nCavity formation in a tooth, due to dental caries is due to:\n* Destructive potential of streptococcus mutans\n* Destructive potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (Correct Answer)\n* Lateral spread of caries along DE junction and weakening of the outer covering enamel\n* Mastectomy force and unrelated to the extent of carious process\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nFontana-Masson stain mainly stains   what granules  in the  cytoplasm\n* Melanin (Correct Answer)\n* Copper\n* Ferritin\n* Hemoglobin\n\nExplanation: Fontana masson  stains  mainly used to detect melanin granules in cytoplasm of tumour cells  of melanoma.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nIn a chronic smoker, bronchi showed stratified squamous cells with underlying glands. What type of change is this?\n* Metaplasia (Correct Answer)\n* Anaplasia\n* Dysplasia\n* Neoplasia\n\nExplanation: Metaplasia Normally in bronchi -pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium is present. In chronic smoker,Replaced by -stratified squamous epithelium. This type of change in epithelium is called as Metaplasia. *Commonest connective tissue metaplasia is Myositis ossificans. *Metaplasia is a benign, reversible condition. Differentiation The extent to which neoplastic parenchymal cells resemble the corresponding normal parenchymal cells, both morphologically and functionally Lack of differentiation is called Anaplasia (hallmark of malignancy). Features of Anaplasia: Pleomorphism Tumor giant cells Atypical mitoses Loss of polarity Dysplasia Means \"disordered growth.\" Dysplastic cells may exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often contain large hyperchromatic nuclei with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Carcinoma in situ When dysplastic changes are marked and involve the full thickness of the epithelium But the lesion does not penetrate the basement membrane, it is considered a preinvasive neoplasm Fig:-Caracinoma in Situ A:- (Low power view) Atypical dysplastic cells B:-(High power view) Nuclear and cellular pleomorphism, and Mitotic figures seen\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nWhen carcinoma of stomach develops secondarily to pernicious anemia, it is usually situated in the ?\n* Prepyloric region\n* Pylorus\n* Body (Correct Answer)\n* Fundus\n\nExplanation: Ans. is `d' i.e., Fundus Pernicious anemia is associated with autoimmune atrophic gastritis affecting the fundic glands. Intestinal metaplasia (premalignant for gastric carcinoma),is charachterstically seen in this area of atrophic gastritis. Atrophic glands with extensive intestinal metaplasia are most charachteristically confined to the fundus in patients with pernicious anaemia.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nGs-alpha mutation may lead to? -\n* Mc cune Albright syndrome\n* Pseudohypoparathyroidism\n* Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (Correct Answer)\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: G(s) alpha mutations in fibrous dysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome. Weinstein LS1. Author information Abstract Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a focal bone lesion composed of immature mesenchymal osteoblastic precursor cells. Some FD patients also have hyperpigmented skin lesions (cafe-au-lait spots), gonadotropin-independent sexual precocity, and/or other endocrine and nonendocrine manifestations (McCune-Albright syndrome ). MAS results from somatic mutations occurring during early development, resulting in a widespread mosaic of normal and mutant-bearing cells, which predicts that the clinical presentation of each patient is determined by the extent and distribution of abnormal cells. These mutations encode constitutively active forms of G(s)alpha, the ubiquitously expressed G protein alpha-subunit that couples hormone receptors to intracellular cAMP generation. These mutations lead to substitution of amino acid residues that are critical for the intrinsic GTPase activity that is normally required to deactivate the G protein. It also may lead to pseudo and psuedopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nTophi in gout found in all regions except -a)  Joint capsuleb)  Skinc)  Muscled)  Articular cartilagee)  Synovial membrane\n* ae (Correct Answer)\n* b\n* ab\n* ad\n\nExplanation: Tophi are pathognomic of gout.

D: Autosplenectomy Sickle cell anemia causes autosplenism by causing hypoxia and infarcts in the spleen. Since in the spleen blood flow is sluggish, the oxygen tension is low. When red blood cells with hemogblobin S are exposed to this low oxygen tension they tend to aggregate and polymerize. Sickled cells also express more adhesion molecules and appear more sticky. The sickle cells arrest in the hypoxic vascular bed in the spleen, resulting in a vicious cycle: decrease in 02, sickling and vascular obstruction from thrombus formation. Initially the spleen is enlarged, then progressively becomes smaller. The stasis of flow in the spleen causes hypoxic damage, thrombosis, infarction and fibrosis. In the end the spleen \"disappears\" completely (termed 'autosplenectomy').\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nTypical histological change seen in benign hypertension includes\n* Formation of new vessels\n* Loss of endothelial cells of arterioles\n* Fibrinoid necrosis of small sized arterie/sarterioles (Correct Answer)\n* Intimal proliferation and hyalinization of muscular media of medium sized arteries/arterioles\n\nExplanation: Hypertension not only accelerate atherogenesis but also causes degenerative changes in the walls of large and medium sized arteries that can lead to aortic dissection and cerebro vascular hemmorage Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is associated with benign hypertension\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nWhich of the following is premalignant to cholangiocarcinoma -\n* Biliary' intraepithelial neoplasia\n* Mucinous cystic neoplasms\n* Intraductal pappilary biliary' neoplasia (Correct Answer)\n* All the above\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., All the above o Premalignant lesions for cholangiocarcinoma are also known, the most important of which are bibary intraepithelial neoplasias (low to high grade, BilIN-1, -2, or -3).o BilIN-3, the highest grade lesion, incurs the highest risk of malignant transformation.o More rare are mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary biliary> neoplasia\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nAll of the following are seen in lead poisoning except:\n* Hallucinations (Correct Answer)\n* GIT disturbances\n* Peripheral neuritis\n* Encephalitis\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nThe histology of Lobular carcinoma of breast reveals-\n* Single file pattern (Correct Answer)\n* Pleomorphic cells in sheets\n* Clustersl/lslands of cells with mucous lakes\n* Solid syncytium like sheets\n\nExplanation: Invasive lobular carcinoma consists of cells morphologically identical to the cells of LCIS. Two thirds of the cases are associated with adjacent LCIS. The cells invade individually into stroma and are often aligned in \"single-file\" strands or chains. This growth pattern correlates with the presence of mutations that abrogate the function of E-cadherin, a surface protein that contributes to the cohesion of normal breast epithelial cells. ref : Robbins Basic Pathology, 9E,page-711 REF of IMG :\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nWhich of the following pathway is seen in basal cell carcinoma\n* mTOR (Correct Answer)\n* Sonic Hedgehog\n* WNT\n* RAS\n\nExplanation: Answer- B.

This gray or bluish black line of sulfide pigmentation occurs in the gingiva, but is somewhat more diffuse than that of bismuth. It is also found occasionally in other areas of the oral cavity. Ulcerative stomatitis is an additional reported finding.\nExcessive salivation and a metallic taste are also common complaints in this condition, as is swelling of the salivary glands. It is reported by Altshuller and his associates that lead is deposited in the deciduous teeth of children suffering from lead poisoning, and that those teeth may serve as an index of the body burden of lead.\nKey concept:\nBurton's line, also known as the Burton line or Burtonian line, is a clinical sign found in patients with chronic lead poisoning. It is a very thin, black-blue line visible along the margin of the gums.\nRef - Shafers 7th Ed P:558\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nWhich of these is characteristic of amyloidosis ?\n* Beta pleated, metachromosis, PAS + ye\n* Congophilic, beta pleated, PAS +ve (Correct Answer)\n* Beta pleated, fibrillary, congophilic\n* Alpha pleated, small fibrils\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Beta pleated, fibrillary, congophilic\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nA 67-year-old man with Parkinson disease has experienced an increasingly dry mouth for the past 3 months, and this interferes with eating and swallowing. He has noted dry eyes as well. On physical examination he has minimal tremor at rest; there are no other abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show no detectable autoantibodies. Which of the following is the most likely cause for his findings?\n* Alcohol ingestion (Correct Answer)\n* Anticholinergic drug use\n* Candidiasis\n* Sialadenitis with blockage of salivary duct\n\nExplanation: The most common cause for dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia) is a medication effect. Anticholinergics such as trihexyphenidyl to treat the parkinsonian tremor can be implicated, as well as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antihistaminics. Alcohol and tobacco use are risks for precancerous lesions and squamous cancers of the oral cavity. The lack of saliva is unlikely to be associated with infection, which tends to be focal.

C: Acute pancreatitis Hypoalbuminemia is the most common cause of hypocalcemia and is due to cirrhosis, nephrosis, malnutrition, burns, chronic illness, and sepsis. Hypomagnesemia causes end-organ resistance to PTH and inhibits the hypocalcemic feedback loop through unceain mechanisms. Causes of hypomagnesemia include pancreatitis, aminoglycoside treatment, amphotericin B, loop diuretics, alcoholism, and malnutrition. Hyperphosphatemia may be seen in critical illness and in patients who have ingested phosphate-containing enemas. Phosphate binds calcium avidly, causing acute hypocalcemia. Multifactorial causes are probably the most clinically relevant hypocalcemic emergencies include the following: - Acute pancreatitis: Free fatty acids chelate calcium, causing saponification in the retroperitoneum. - Rhabdomyolysis: Increased phosphates from creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and other anions (i.e., lactate, bicarbonate) chelate calcium. - Sepsis can cause hypocalcemia through many mechanisms. - Toxic shock syndrome can cause hypocalcemia. High calcitonin levels cause low calcium. - Malignancy: Osteoblastic metastases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer) and tumor lysis syndrome may cause hypocalcemia (by differing mechanisms). - Hepatic or renal insufficiency: Calciuresis, hypomagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low active vitamin D levels may contribute to poor calcium homeostasis. - Infiltrative disease: Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and hemochromatosis may infiltrate the parathyroids, causing dysfunction. -- Toxicologic causes include hydrofluoric acid burn or ingestion. Enhanced protein binding and anion chelation - Protein binding is enhanced by elevated pH and free fatty acid release in high catecholamine states. Anion chelation is seen in high phosphate states (e.g., renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, mesenteric ischemia, oral administration of phosphate-containing enemas); high citrate states (e.g., massive blood transfusion, radiocontrast dyes); and high bicarbonate, lactate, and oxalate levels. Medication effects - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production resulting in reduced calcium absorption. - Selective serotonin inhibitors can have a calcium antagonistic effect on smooth muscle, paicularly vascular endothelium. - Calcitonin and bisphosphonates cause chelation and end-organ inhibition. - Phenobarbital and phenytoin enhance vitamin D catabolism and decrease calcium resorption in the gut. Foscarnet complexes with calcium. Fluoride, paicularly hydrofluoric acid, chelates calcium avidly and causes profound hypocalcemia. Ethylene glycol complexes with calcium. Estrogen inhibits bone resorption. Cimetidine decreases gastric pH, slowing fat breakdown, which is necessary to complex calcium for gut absorption. Aluminum and alcohol suppress PTH. Gadolinium-based contrast material can falsely lower serum calcium levels and should be considered if levels are drawn sholy after magnetic resonance imaging. Postsurgical effects Parathyroid adenoma resection causes a transient hypocalcemia due to end-organ PTH resistance in the first postoperative day. Pancreatectomy prevents calcium absorption in the duodenum and the jejunum by eliminating necessary enzymes. Small bowel syndrome causes hypocalcemia by reducing the surface available to absorb fatty acids and calcium. PTH deficiency/resistance Infiltrative diseases include Wilson disease and metastatic cancer. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to PTH resistance and has many forms, most notably Albright disease. Renal failure can result in a variety of endocrine disorders, occasionally including hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency/resistance - Rickets may be due to lack of vitamin D or end-organ receptor resistance. - Hepatorenal disease: The liver and the kidney provide intermediary enzymes to form active 1,25 (OH)2 D.\n\n## Question from Pathology:\nThe gene suppresses apoptosis is\n* BCL - 2 (Correct Answer)\n* BAK\n* BAX\n* BAD\n\nExplanation: Atni apoptotic Genes: BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1.

Brain growth continues, giving the head a misshapen appearance Craniosynostosis usually involves fusion of a single cranial suture, but can involve more than one of the sutures in your baby&;s skull (complex craniosynostosis). In rare cases, craniosynostosis is caused by ceain genetic syndromes (syndromic craniosynostosis). Treating craniosynostosis involves surgery to correct the shape of the head and allow for normal brain growth. Early diagnosis and treatment allow your baby&;s brain adequate space to grow and develop. Although neurological damage can occur in severe cases, most children have normal cognitive development and achieve good cosmetic results after surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment are key. Types of Craniosynostosis The types of craniosynostosis depend on what sutures join together early. Sagittal synostosis- The sagittal suture runs along the top of the head, from the baby's soft spot near the front of the head to the back of the head. When this suture closes too early, the baby's head will grow long and narrow (scaphocephaly). It is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal synostosis - The right and left coronal sutures run from each ear to the sagittal suture at the top of the head. When one of these sutures closes too early, the baby may have a flattened forehead on the side of the skull that closed early (anterior plagiocephaly). The baby's eye socket on that side might also be raised up and his or her nose could be pulled toward that side. This is the second most common type of craniosynostosis. Bicoronal synostosis - This type of craniosynostosis occurs when the coronal sutures on both sides of the baby's head close too early. In this case, the baby's head will grow broad and sho (brachycephaly). Lambdoid synostosis - The lambdoid suture runs along the backside of the head. If this suture closes too early, the baby's head may be flattened on the back side (posterior plagiocephaly). This is one of the rarest types of craniosynostosis. Metopic synostosis - The metopic suture runs from the baby's nose to the sagittal suture at the top of the head. If this suture closes too early, the top of the baby's head shape may look triangular, meaning narrow in the front and broad in the back (trigonocephaly). This is one of the rarest types of craniosynostosis.

Here children grow normally upto 6-12 months of life. Thereafter, there is deceleration such that the height and weight fall below the 3rd centile. By 3 yrs of age,normal height velocity is resumed and continues to grow below and parallel to the 3rd centile. Here pubey is delayed; And the bone age is consistent with the child&;s height age, but lower than the chronological age by 2-3 yrs , unlike in the familial sho stature. Hence IGF-1 produced is low for the chronological age but consistent with the bone age that corresponds to the height age. Ref.

Fuher examination reveals upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, excess nuchal skin, an enlarged tongue, clinodactyly of the fifth fingers, and a single transverse palmar crease. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n* Down syndrome (Correct Answer)\n* Edwards syndrome\n* Fetal alcohol syndrome\n* Marfan syndrome\n\nExplanation: Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is the most common autosomal chromosome abnormality. The incidence increases as maternal age increases. The classic features are hypotonia, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, excess nuchal skin, an enlarged tongue, clinodactyly of the fifth fingers, and a single transverse palmar crease. Edwards syndrome or trisomy 18, has features of small palpebral fissures, low-set ears, low bih weight, microcephaly, rocker-bottom feet, cleft lip, hypotonia, and clenched hands. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by growth retardation, small palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, a thin upper lip, microcephaly, and a sho nose. Features often go unnoticed in the newborn period, although sometimes tremulousness and irritability occur. Marfan syndrome is associated with increased stature, thin limbs, scoliosis, joint hypermobility, and ocular manifestations. Features often go unnoticed in the newborn period.

Fatty acid b-oxidation fuels hepatic ketogenesis, which provides a major source of energy once hepatic glycogen stores become depleted during prolonged fasting and periods of higher energy demands. MCAD deficiency is the most common disorder of fatty acid b-oxidation and one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Most children are now diagnosed through newborn screening. Clinical symptoms in a previously apparently healthy child with MCAD deficiency include hypoketotic hypoglycemia and vomiting that may progress to lethargy, seizures, and coma triggered by a common illness. Hepatomegaly and liver disease are often present during an acute episode.

A few hours before his presentation to the emergency room, he has an abrupt onset of high fever, difficulty swallowing, and poor handling of his secretions. He indicates that he has a marked worsening in the severity of his sore throat. His pharynx has a fluctuant bulge in the posterior wall. A soft tissue radiograph of his neck is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?\n* Narcotic analgesics\n* Trial of oral penicillin V (Correct Answer)\n* Surgical consultation for incision and drainage under general anesthesia\n* Rapid streptococcal screen\n\nExplanation: Suppurative infection of the chain of lymph nodes between the posterior pharyngeal wall and the prevertebral fascia leads to retropharyngeal abscesses. The most common causative organisms are S aureus, group A b-hemolytic streptococci, and oral anaerobes. Presenting signs and symptoms include a history of pharyngitis, abrupt onset of fever with severe sore throat, refusal of food, drooling, and muffled or noisy breathing. A bulge in the posterior pharyngeal wall is diagnostic, as are radiographs of the lateral neck that reveal the retropharyngeal mass (the radiograph in the question demonstrates thickening of the prevertebral space). Palpation (with adequate provision for emergency control of the airway in case of rupture) reveals a fluctuant mass. Treatment should include incision and drainage if fluctuance is present. The other answers listed would delay definitive treatment and/or might be life threatening.\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nThe mother of this newborn had fever with rash at 18 weeks of gestation.

Next step is:\n* Start azithromycin (Correct Answer)\n* Blood monospot test and CBC\n* IgE for IMN\n* Presume it as EBV and start acyclovir and prednisolone\n\nExplanation: Arts) b (Blood monospot test and CBC) Ref Nelson 18th ed p1375The features given in the question are classically seen in IMN. So the next step is to confirm the diagnosis by monospot test and CBC and then only start treatment with acyclovir and steroids.There are rapid IgM and IgG antibody which is used in the diagnosis, but IgE antibody assay is not usedInfectious mononucleosisInfectious mononucleosis is the best-known clinical syndrome caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is characterized by systemic somatic complaints consisting primarily of fatigue, malaise, fever, sore throat, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Originally described as glandular fever, it derives its name from the mononuclear lymphocytosis with atypical-appearing lymphocytes that accompany the illness.Primary EBV infection in adolescents and adults manifests in >50% of cases as the classic triad of fatigue, pharyngitis, and generalized lymphadenopathy, which constitute the major clinical manifestations of infectious mononucleosis.The physical examination is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy (90% of cases), splenomegaly (50% of cases), and hepatomegaly (10% of cases). Lymphadenopathy occurs most commonly in the anterior and posterior cervical nodes and the submandibular lymph nodes and less commonly in the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes.Epitrochlear lymphadenopathy is particularly suggestive of infectious mononucleosis.The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis implies primary EBV infection. A presumptive diagnosis may be made by the presence of typical clinical symptoms with atypical lymphocytosis the peripheral blood.The diagnosis is usually confirmed by serologic testing, either for heterophile antibody or specific EBV antibodies.Approximately 5% of cases of EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis have positive throat cultures for group A streptococcus', this represents pharyngeal streptococcal carriage. Failure of a patient with streptococcal pharyngitis to improve within 48-72 hr should evoke suspicion of infectious mononucleosis.EBV-specific antibody testing is useful to confirm acute EBV infection, especially in heterophile-negative cases, or to confirm past infection and determine susceptibility to future infection.The EBNA, EA, and VCA antigen systems are most useful for diagnostic purposes.The acute phase of infectious mononucleosis is characterized by rapid IgM and IgG antibody responses to VCA in all cases and an IgG response to EA in most cases.\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nHypoglycemia in neonates occurs in blood glucose less than\n* 20 mg% (Correct Answer)\n* 40 mg%\n* 60 mg%\n* 10mg%\n\nExplanation: B. i.e. (40%) (177 - Ghai 6th) (155.

The most likely diagnosis is –\n* EHPVO (Correct Answer)\n* NCPF\n* Cirrhosis\n* Malaria with DIC\n\nExplanation: Information in question are:\n\n\nPatient is 12 years male\nHematemesis, melena and mild splenomegaly —k signs of portal hypertension\nNo Jaundice or Ascitis\n\n\nSo, the boy in question has portal hypertension.\nThree most common causes of portal hypertension are:\n\n\nExtrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO)\nNon-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF)\nCirrhosis.\n\n\nIn cirrhosis, jaundice & ascitis are prominent. So, this option is ruled out.\nNow we are left with EHPVO and NCPF. Both these causes non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, i.e. portal hypertension without signs of liver dysfunction.\nBoth these have similar clinical picture except for the age of presentation.\nEHPVO is usually' seen in young male children (1st and 2nd decade) while NCPF is a disease of adults (25-35 years).\nSo, best answer here is EHPVO.\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nAnterior fontanelle closes at ____________\n* < 3months\n* 12months (Correct Answer)\n* 12-18months\n* > 3years\n\nExplanation: The posterior fontanelle generally closes 2 to 3 months after bih; The sphenoidal fontanelle is the next toclose around 6 months after bih; The mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6 to 18 months after bih; and.

Trisomy 21(Ref: Nelson's 20/e p 618-619)Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) is the most common of the chromosomal disorder.Trisomy 16 is the most common trisomy overall, however most do not survive and die in utero Hence, among the live births, or among children, most common chromosomal abnormality is Trisomy 21\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nIn neonatal resuscitation, which of the following drug is used?\n* Dopamine (Correct Answer)\n* Sodium Bicarbonate\n* Noradrenaline\n* Dobutamine\n\nExplanation: Impoant drugs used for neonatal resuscitation areEpinephrine (adrenaline)Normal saline or ringer lactateNaloxone and sodium bicarbonateAlso, knowDose of adrenaline in neonatal resuscitation: 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg diluted 1:10,000.(Ref: NRP guidelines 2015)\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nThe commonest cyanotic hea disease manifesting as congestive cardiac failure during first week of life is -\n* Pulmonary stenosis\n* Fallot's tetralogy\n* Tricuspid atresia (Correct Answer)\n* Hypoplastic left hea syndorme\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., Hypoplastic left hea syndrome o Amongst the given options, hypoplastic left hea syndrome causes CHF in First week. o Different congenital diseases have different time of onset of CHF : - 1)Left to right shunt o At bih, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, i.e., the pressure on side of circulation is high --> Pulmonary pressure is almost equal to systemic pressure. So, left to right shunt is small, whether the communication is atrial, ventricular or pulmonary aery level. As the neonate grows, pulmonary vascular resistance falls with maximum fall at the age of six to eight weeks (Note - In normal neonate, maximum fall is between 1 to 3 weeks). o This is the time (six to eight weeks) when the size of shunt is maximum as pulmonary vascular resistance is least at this time. So, patients with left to right shunts tend to develop CCF around six to eight weeks of life. 2)Right to left shunt Patients with right to left shunt may have : ? a) Shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary aery level. b)Shunt at atrial level o Patients with shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary aery level do not develop CCF because the right ventricle is dompressed by the shunt. o Patients with shunt at atrial level may have. i) Obstruction at right ventricular outlet (Pulmonary stenosis or atresia) --> CCF develops in the first few days of life as ventricle does not decompress fully because shunt is at atrial level. ii) Obstruction at right ventricular inlet (Tricuspid atresia) CCF usually does not occur as there is no volume overload to right ventricle. But these patients develop congestive symptoms when the shunt is small. 3) Obstructive lesions o If the stenosis is critical (e.g., in aoic or pulmonary atresia), CCF may develop early because of impaired ventricular decompression. o Coarctation of aoa may develop CCF with in 1-4 weeks of life. However, if these patients do not manifest CCF in the first year of life, collaterals develop and prevent onset of failure by decompressing the obstruction. 4) Transposition o Patients with transposition of great aeries, develop CCF within first week of life, when there is no ventricular communication and the only mixing site is at the atrial level --> Hypoxemia along with anoxic myocardium results in tachycardia that causes CCF. o Patients with transposition of great aeries with an adequate ventricular defect and patients with transposition of pulmonary veins develop CCF somewhat later, usually by the age of six to eight weeks, following the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance as in patient with left to right shunt.\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nWhich among the following is the most common cause of temper tantrum?\n* Autism (Correct Answer)\n* Bad parenting\n* ADHD\n* Behavioural problems\n\nExplanation: Ans: b (Bad parenting) Ref: Nelson, 18th ed, p. 47, 56,131; 17th ed, p. 18, 50, 88; OP Ghai, 6th ed, p. 56Temper tantrums are a normal part of childhood development and as the question states, there is no common cause given clearly in the textbooks, but out of the options, most probable answer would be bad parenting.Temper tantrums are normal part of child development.Characterizing the type of tantrum may help the parents to understand and so that different approaches can be used to deal with the condition.Types of tantrumsa) Frustration or fatigue relatedb) Attention seeking or demandingc) Refusald) DisruptiveEven though temper tantrums are normal part of childhood and parenting, it is important to asses families to determine if there are contributing factors such as parental depression or family violence.Tantrums normally appear towards the first year of life and peak in prevalence between 2 year and 4 year of age.Tantiums lasting more than 15 minutes or regularly occurring more than 3 times a day may reflect underlying medical, emotional or social problems.Frequent tantiums after 5 years of age tend to persist throughout childhood.The rule of thumb for the length of time out in managing tantrum is approximately 1 minute per year of age.Most toddlers respond with tantrums as parents impose limits that restrict their autonomy.(Same question was asked in Kerala, 2006 but the choice \"bad parenting was not there, instead \"improper teaching habits \"was given in the choice, which was the answer.)\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\n\"Potter's syndrome\" is associated with:\n* Renal anomalies\n* Severe oligohydramnios\n* Flattened nose (Correct Answer)\n* All the above\n\nExplanation: d. All the above(Ref: Nelson's 20/e p 2554-2555)Potter Syndrome:Bilateral renal agenesis and Pulmonary hypoplasia are seenPotter facies: widely separated eyes with epicanthic folds, low set ears, broad compressed flat nose, receding chinThis condition is incompatible with life, death occurs shortly after birth from pulmonary hypoplasiaMaternal USG demonstrates, Oligohydramnios, Non-visualization of bladder, Absent fetal kidney\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nWhich of the following is diagnostic for juvenile idiopathic ahritis (JIA)?\n* Anti-nuclear antibody\n* ESR\n* Rheumatoid factor (Correct Answer)\n* clinical diagnosis without any diagnostic laboory tests\n\nExplanation: Juvenile Idiopathic ahritis (JIA) is a clinical diagnosis without any diagnostic laboory tests. The meticulous clinical exclusion of other diseases and many mimicking conditions is , therefore essential. Laboratory studies, including tests for ANA and RF, are only suppoive or prognostic, and their results may be normal in patients with JIA.

The trunk appears long and narrow. to confirm the diagnosis you should -\n* Order an ophthalmologic examination (Correct Answer)\n* Obtain skeletal radiographs\n* Order chromosome analysis\n* Examine the parents\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., Obtain skeletal radiographs o In case of dispropoionate limbs and trunk, arrange for skeletal X-rays.\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nWhich one of the following is the characteristic feature of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?\n* Myoclonic seizures frequently occur in morning (Correct Answer)\n* Complete remission is common\n* Response to anticonvulsants is poor\n* Associated absence seizures are present in majority of patients\n\nExplanation: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a generalized seizure disorder of unknown cause that appears in early adolescence and is usually characterized by bilateral myoclonic jerks that may be single or repetitive. The myoclonic seizures are most frequent in the morning after awakening and can be provoked by sleep deprivation. Consciousness is preserved unless the myoclonus is especially severe. Many patients also experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and up to one-third have absence seizures. Although complete remission is relatively uncommon, the seizures respond well to appropriate anticonvulsant medication. There is often a family history of epilepsy, and genetic linkage studies suggest a polygenic cause. Ref: Lowenstein D.H. (2012). Chapter 369. Seizures and Epilepsy. In D.L. Longo, A.S. Fauci, D.L. Kasper, S.L. Hauser, J.L. Jameson, J. Loscalzo (Eds), Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18e.\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nA 1.5 Kg child born at 32 weeks through LSCS, presents with moderate respiratory difficulty. Which of the following is the appropriate management -?\n* CPAP (Correct Answer)\n* Mechanical ventilation\n* Warm oxygen\n* Surfactant and ventilation\n\nExplanation: CPAP The symptoms suggests neonatal respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane disease. Respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane disease occurs because of inadequate production of surfactant. - Since surfactant deficiency is the basis of RDS, exogenous surfactant is now recommended as the treatment of choice in neonates with RDS. - It is given to all neonates less than 28 weeks irrespective of presence or absence of RDS (Rescue treatment). -Beyond this age surfactant therapy is given according to the clinical condition of the patient. - If the distress is severe surfactant is required. - In the question the neonate is 32 weeks old and presents with moderate respiratory distress. - Surfactant is not necessary in such patient. Remember \"Surfactant is not universally indicated in all cases of respiratory distress syndrome\". Management of Respiratory distress syndrome Management of respiratory distress syndrome begins with administration of warm humidified oxygen. - This should maintain the aerial levels between 50 and 70 mm Hg (85-95% saturation) to maintain normal tissue oxygenation. If Pa02 cannot be maintained above 50 min Hg at inspired 02 concentration of 60% or greater CPAP should be applied. - If the patient is VLBW (very low bih weight) then CPAP is used early (t/t begins with CPAP instead of oxygen). - Another approach in VLBW infant is to intubate the infant, administer intracheal surfactant, then extubutate the patient and put him on CPAP. (In the question the infant is 1.5 kg at 32 weeks, his weight for age is adequate). Infants with severe RDS require mechanical ventilation.\n\n## Question from Pediatrics:\nA child can wave \"bye-bye\" by what age:\n* 6 months (Correct Answer)\n* 9 months\n* 12 months\n* 18 months\n\nExplanation: Ans.

At this time the physician should expect to see _____________\n* Stranger anxiety\n* A pincer grasp\n* Object permanence (Correct Answer)\n* Sitting with suppo\n\nExplanation: Sitting with suppo is normally seen in a 5-month old infant. Stranger anxiety (fear of unfamiliar people) does not appear until approximately 7 months of age. A pincer grasp (using thumb and forefinger) appears at approximately 9 months of age, whereas object permanence (the ability to maintain a mental representation of an object although it can no longer be seen) occurs between 12 and 18 months of age. Using meaningful words is not commonly present until at least 12 months of age.

It enhances polymerization of tubulin: a mechanism opposite to that of vinca alkaloids. The microtubules are stabilized and their depolymerization is prevented. This stability results in inhibition of normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic functions. Abnormal arrays or &;bundles&; of microtubules are produced throughout the cell cycle. Cytotoxic action of paclitaxel emphasizes the impoance of tubulin-microtubule dynamic equilibrium. The approved indications of paclitaxel are metastatic ovarian and breast carcinoma after failure of first line chemotherapy and relapse cases. It has also shown efficacy in advanced cases of head and neck cancer, small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma and hormone refractory prostate cancer. The major toxicity is reversible myelosuppression and &;stocking and glove&; neuropathy. Chest pain, ahralgia, myalgia, mucositis and edema can be troublesome.The syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion is attributed to excessive ADH release. It is defined as less than maximally dilute urine in the presence of plasma hypoosmolality (hyponatremia), without volume depletion or overload, emotional stress, pain, diuretics or other drugs that stimulate ADH secretion. Paclitaxel regimen, cause severe hyponatremia (grade 4) due to documented syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

B i.e. 10 minutes Degradation of insulin Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell. The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney. The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of insulin-degrading enzyme. An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the pancreatic beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (insulin half-life - 4-6 minutes)\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nSteroid with max mineralocoicoid activity ?\n* Fludrocoisone (Correct Answer)\n* DOCA\n* Prednisolone\n* Triamsinolone\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e, Fludrocoisone\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nWhich of the following is not an H2 blocker -\n* Cimetidine (Correct Answer)\n* Oxyphenonium\n* Roxatidine\n* Ranitidine\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., Oxyphenonium Drugs for peptic ulcer1.

TRPV-1(Ref: Oxford textbook of Palliative care for children p. 712)Paracetamol was shown to be conveed in the brain and spinal cord through a precess of deacetylation followed by conjugation with arachidonic acid to form N-arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404).AM404 is a known endogenous cannabinoid.Functions both as a potent actiyator of vanilloid subtype 1 receptors (TWV-1).Inhibitor of cellular anandamide uptake.Increases other endogenous cannabinoids levels acting directly on cannabinoid-1 receptors (CBI).TRPVI and CBI receptors are present in pain and thermoregulatory pathways, giving paracetamol its analgesic and antipyretic actions.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nMetaclopramide all are true except ?\n* Increase gastric emptying (Correct Answer)\n* D2-agonist\n* Acts on CTZ\n* Long term use can cause parkinsonism, galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., D,-agonist Metaclopramide is D2-antagonist (not agonist). Metoclopramide Metoclopramide is aprokinetic drug. It has more prominent effect on upper GIT- increases gastric peristalsis, while relaxing the pylorus and the first pa of duodenum - speed gastric emptying. Tone of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is increased and gastroesophageal reflux opposed. But has no significant action on colonic motility. An effective antiemetic. Mechanism of action. I. 5-HT4agonism - stimulation of 5-HT4 receptor in GIT enhances the release of ACH from myenteric plexus - Main prokinetic action of metoclopropamide is due to this action. D2 antagonism - Blockade of D2 receptor in CTZ is mainly responsible for antiemetic effect. D2 receptor blockade in GIT is responsible for some prokinetic action also. Adverse effects - Sedation, dizziness, loose stools, muscle dystonia (especially in children) are the main side effects. D2 -blocking action may cause extrapyramidal symptoms (Akathsia, Parkinsonism) and hyperprolactinemia (galactorrhea, gynacomastia).\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nA very potent and short-acting benzodiazepine was given to a patient Kallu for the purpose of causing hypnosis but the drug caused psychiatric disturbances in him.

B: Enalapril Few drugs are inactive as such and need conversion in the body to one or more active metabolites. Such drug is called a prodrug. Carisoprodol is metabolized into meprobamate. Enalapril is conveed by esterase to the active enalaprilat. Acyclovir is conveed into the active acyclovir triphosphate. Fosamprenavir is hydrolysed to the active amprenavir. Levodopa is conveed by DOPA decarboxylase to the active dopamine. Chloramphenicol succinate ester is used as an intravenous prodrug of chloramphenicol, because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water. Psilocybin is dephosphorylated to the active psilocin. Heroin is deacetylated by esterase to the active morphine. Codeine is demethylated by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 to the active morphine, as well as several other compounds that may be active in analgesia. Molsidomine is metabolized into SIN-1 which decomposes into the active compound nitric oxide. Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic for schizophrenia. It is the active metabolite of risperidone. Prednisone, a synthetic coico-steroid drug, is conveed by the liver into the active drug prednisolone, which is also a steroid. Primid one is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes into phenobarbital, which is major and phenylethylmalonamide, which is minor. Dipivefrine, given topically as an anti-glaucoma drug, is conveed to epinephrine. Lisdexamfetamine is metabolized in the small intestine to produce dextroamphetamine at a controlled (slow) rate for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diethylpropion is a diet pill that does not become active as a monoamine releaser or reuptake inhibitor until it has been N-dealkylated to ethylpropion. Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic that is conveed to tolterodine. Alpha-methyldopa is conveed into alpha-methylnorepinephrine. Sulindac is conveed into sulfide metabolite. Proguanil is conveed into cycloguanil.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nDrug used for smoking cessation\n* Varenicline (Correct Answer)\n* Nalmefene\n* Gabapentin\n* Acamprosate\n\nExplanation: Varenicline * Varenicline - paial agonist at alpha 3 beta 4, alpha 4 beta 2 & alpha 6 beta 2 subtypes of nAChRs and agonist at alpha 7 nicotinic Acetyl Choline Receptors.

A. CMV. (Ref. H - 17th/pg. 2633; 847; 1092)Harrison's internal medicine 17th/pg. 1092.......GANCICLOVIR is an analogue of acyclovir, ganciclovir is active against HSV and VZV and is markedly more active than acyclovir against CMV.Harrison's internal medicine 17th/pg. 847 .......\"With the development of highly effective oral antiviral agents, CMV immune globulin is no longer used. Ganciclovir (valganciclovir) is beneficial when prophylaxis is indicated and for the Rx of serious CMV disease. Acyclovir (Valacyclovir) is less efficacious but also less toxic than ganciclovir (Valganciclovir). The availability of Valganciclovir and Valacyclovir has allowed most centers to move to oral prophylaxis for transplant recipients. Additional oral prophylactic agents, such as maribavir, are in clinical study\".# Ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscamet, and cidofovir are approved for Rx of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS. They are also used for colitis, pneumonia, or \"wasting\" syndrome associated with CMV and for prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients.GANCICLOVIR AND VALGANCICLOVIR# An analogue of acyclovir. ganciclovir is active against HSV and VZV and is markedly more active than acyclovir against CMV.# Ganciclovir is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of 2?-deoxyguanosine. The drug is preferentially phosphorylated by virus-induced cellular kinases.# Ganciclovir triphosphate acts as a competitive inhibitor of the CMV DNA polymerase, and its incorporation into nascent viral DNA results in premature chain termination.# In HSV- and VZV-infected cells, ganciclovir is phosphorylated by virus-encoded thymidine kinases; in CMV-infected cells, it is phosphorylated by a viral kinase encoded by the UL97 gene.# Ganciclovir is approved for the Rx of CMV retinitis in immunosuppressed patients and for the prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. It is widely used for the Rx of other CMV-associated syndromes, including pneumonia, esophagoGI infections, hepatitis, and \"wasting\" illness.# Oral ganciclovir has largely been supplanted by valganciclovir, which is the L-valyl ester of ganciclovir & is frequently used in place of IV ganciclovir.- Intraocular ganciclovir, given by either intravitreal injection or intraocular implantation, has also been used to treat CMV retinitis.# Valganciclovir is well absorbed orally, with a bioavailability of 60%, and is rapidly hydrolyzed to ganciclovir in the intestine and liver. The area under the curve for a 900-mg dose of valganciclovir is equivalent to that for 5 mg/kg of ganciclovir given IV, although peak serum concentrations are -40% lower for valganciclovir. The serum half-life is 3.5 h after IV administration of ganciclovir and 4.0 h after PO administration of valganciclovir.# Valganciclovir is an orally bioavailability prodrug that can generate high serum levels of ganciclovir, although studies of its efficacy in treating CMV CNS infections are limited.Foscarnet# is a pyrophosphate analogue that inhibits viral DNA polymerases by binding to the pyrophosphate-binding site.# Foscarnet is poorly soluble and must be administered IV via an in- fusion pump in a dilute solution over 1-2 h.# Foscarnet is approved for the Rx of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS and of acvclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infections. Intraocular foscamet has been used to treat CMV retinitis.# Foscarnet has also been employed to treat acyclovir-resistant HSV and VZV infections as well as ganciclovir- resistant CMV infections, although resistance to foscarnet has been reported in CMV isolates obtained during therapy. Foscarnet has also been used to treat HHV-6 infections in immunosuppressed patients.# The major form of toxicity associated with foscamet is renal impairment. Thus renal function should be monitored closely, particularly during the initial phase of therapy.# Since foscarnet binds divalent metal ions, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypo- or hyperphosphatemia can develop. Saline hydration and slow infusion appear to protect the patient against nephrotoxicity and electrolyte disturbances.# Foscarnet is not myelosuppressive and is active against acyclovir- and ganciclovir-resistant herpesviruses.Cidofovir# Cidofovir is a phosphonate nucleotide analogue of cytosine.# Its major use is in CMV infections. particularly retinitis. but it is active against a broad range of herpes viruses. including HSV. human herpesvirus (HHV) type 6. HHV-8. and certain other DNA viruses such as polyomaviruses. papillomaviruses. adenoviruses. and poxviruses. including variola (smallpox) and vaccinia.# Cidofovir is usually active against foscarnet-resistant CMV. although cross-resistance to foscarnet as well as to ganciclovir has been described.# Cidofovir has poor oral availability and is administered IV. It is excreted primarily by the kidney and has a plasma half- life of 2.6 h.# The major toxic effect of cidofovir is proximal renal tubular injury, as manifested by elevated se- rum creatinine levels and proteinuria. The risk of nephrotoxicity can be reduced by vigorous saline hydration and by concomitant oral probenecid. Neutropenia, rashes, and GI intolerance may also occur.# IV cidofovir has been approved for the Rx of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients who are intolerant of ganciclovir or foscarnet or in whom those drugs have failed.AMCICLOVIR AND PENCICLOVIR# Famciclovir is the diacetyl 6-deoxyester of the guanosine analogue penciclovir.# Famciclovir is well absorbed orally, has a bioavailability of 77%, and is rapidly converted to penciclovir by deacetylation and oxidation in the intestine and liver.# Penciclovir's spectrum of activity and mechanism of action are similar to those of acyclovir. Thus, penciclovir is usually not active against acyclovir-resistant viruses.# Famciclovir is effective as therapy for mucocutaneous HSV infections in HIV-infected patients.Ribavirin (Intravenous)# (15-25 mg/kg per day in divided doses given every 8 h) has been reported to be of benefit in isolated cases of severe encephalitis due to California encephalitis (LaCrosse) virus.# Ribavirin might be of benefit for the rare patients, typically infants or young children, with severe adenovirus or rotavirus encephalitis and in patients with encephalitis due to LCMV or other arenaviruses.# However, clinical trials are lacking. Hemolysis, with resulting anemia, has been the major side effect limiting therapy.TRIFLURIDINE# Trifluridine is a pyrimidine nucleoside active against HSV-1, HSV-2, and CMV.VIDARABINE# Vidarabine is a purine nucleoside analogue with activity against HSV- 1, HSV-2, VZV, and EBV.# Vidarabine inhibits viral DNA synthesis through its 5?-triphosphorylated metabolite.# IV-administered vidarabine has been shown to be effective in the Rx of herpes simplex encephalitis, mucocutaneous HSV infections, herpes zoster in immunocompromised patients, and neonatal HSV infections. Its use has been supplanted by that of IV acyclovir, which is more effective and easier to administer.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nTopical mitomycin C is used in the treatment of aEUR'\n* >Basal skull ca\n* >Tracheal stenosis (Correct Answer)\n* >Skull base osteomyelitis\n* >Angiofibroma\n\nExplanation: Tracheal stenosis Management of tracheal stenosis The optimal treatment of tracheal stenosis remains undefined Traditionally tracheal stenosis has been managed by thoracic and otorhinolaryngology surgeons. Endoscopic procedures are usually performed as bridge to definitive surgical intervention. With the development of interventrical pulmonology field in the last 20 years definitive management of tracheal stenosis using minimally invasive endoscopic methods becomes a possibility. Endoscopic surgery has been shown to be useful especially in patients who are deemed high risk and too unwell for reconstructive surgery. One of the main drawbacks of endoscopic tit and surgery is the risk of recurrence of tracheal stenosis due to granulation and fibrotic tissue. Scar formation and restenosis is the main cause. Studies have shown that most of the recurrence of tracheal stenosis occurs within one to three months after the procedure and use of mitomycin C has been repoed in case studies to reduce the rate of recurrence. - Both in vitro and invivo mitomycin C has been proved to be a potent inhibitor of human fibroblasts at concentrations of .04 mg/L Topical mitomycin C is a useful adjunct in the management of sho concentric membranous stenosis which does not involve the cailage.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nWhich of the following drug has been withdrawn from the market?\n* Nicorandil\n* Ropinrole\n* Rotigotine (Correct Answer)\n* Rofecoxib\n\nExplanation: COXIBS which are selective cox 2 inhibitors are very rarely used and banned from the market due to the high incidence of Myocardial infarction and stroke. these disrupt the ration of TXA2 and PCI thromboxane and prostacycline which leads to long term risk of stroke. Ref: KD Tripathi 6th ed, pg 534 and 197\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nA patient with hypeension also suffers from essential tremor. Optimal treatment of the patient should include management with\n* Propranolol (Correct Answer)\n* Clonidine\n* Metoprolol\n* Lidocaine\n\nExplanation: Essential Tremor is the commonest movement disorder. It can present in childhood but dramatically increases in prevalence over the age of 70 years. ET is characterized by a high-frequency tremor (6-10 Hz) that predominantly affects the upper extremities. The tremor most often manifest as a postural or action (kinetic) tremor and, in severe cases, can interfere with functions such as eating and drinking. It is typically bilateral and symmetric but may begin on one side and remain asymmetric. TREATMENTMany cases are mild and require no treatment other than reassurance. Beta blockers and primidone are the standard drug therapies for ET and help in about 50% of cases. Propranolol (20-120 mg daily, given in divided doses) is usually effective at relatively low doses, but higher doses may be effective in some patients. The drug is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia or asthma.Reference: Harrison&;s Principles of Internal Medicine; 19th edition; Chapter 449 Parkinson's Disease and Other Movement Disorders\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nDepression occurs as a side effect due to the use of:\n* Reserpine (Correct Answer)\n* Propranolol\n* Morphine\n* Amphetamine\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nWhich of the following antihypeensives does not alter serum glucose and lipid levels?\n* Propanolol (Correct Answer)\n* Prazosin\n* Thiazide diuretics\n* Furosemide\n\nExplanation: Prazosin doesn't impair carbohydrate metabolism, suitable for diabetes mellitus, it has only a slight effect on lipid profile. Prazosin is a selective alpha 1 antagonist. Diuretics - cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia Beta-blockers- by blocking beta 2 receptors on liver-could cause hyperglycemia to a slight extent and hyperlipidemia K.D. Tripathi : Essentials of medical pharmacology, seventh edition, page no 564\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nErythromycin acts on which receptor in GITract -\n* Motilin (Correct Answer)\n* Muscarinic\n* Nicotinic\n* Serotonergic\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Motilin * Erythromycin stimulates motilin (an upper gastrointestinal peptide hormone) receptors in the g.i.t.--thereby induces gastric contractions, hastens gastric emptying and promotes intestinal motility without significant effect on colonic motility.* On the basis of this action erythromycin has been occasionally used to afford short-term symptomatic relief in diabetic gastroparesis. However, tolerance quickly develops to this action (probably due to receptor down- regulation) and undesirable alteration of bacterial flora limit use of erythromycin as a prokinetic agent. Contribution of this action to the g.i. side effects of erythromycin is not known.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nA patient on antitubercular treatment shows sputum positivity at the end of intensive phase under category I.

Isoniazid is metabolized to acetyl-isoniazid and then to acetyl hydrazine. Accumulation of isoniazid is responsible for peripheral neuropathy whereas acetylhydrazine accumulation may cause hepatotoxicity. Thus, slow acetylators will not be able to metabolize the drug quickly and there can be an accumulation of parent drug (isoniazid in this case), leading to peripheral neuropathy. On the other hand, fast acetylators are more prone to develop hepatotoxicity.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nAllopurinol is used in treatment of:\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Psoriatic arthritis (Correct Answer)\n* Gouty arthritis\n* Poly sero arthritis\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Gouty arthritis* Allopurinol is a hypoxanthine analogue which was synthesized as a purine anti metabolite.* Allopurinol is xanthine oxidase inhibitor.* Uses:# Allopurinol is the first choice drug for chronic gout. It can be used for both over producers as well as under excretors of uric acid.# With long term allopurinol therapy, tophi gradually disappear and nephropathy is halted and even reversed.* Allopurinol is contraindicated in acute gout because a sudden decrease in urate levels may precipitate re - crystallization in the joints.* Other uses# Allopurinol may be used in some cases of kala azar or leishmaniasis but efficacy is doubtful.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nAll of the following can be used for prophylaxis of migraine except :\n* Sumatriptan (Correct Answer)\n* Valproate\n* Propranolol\n* Topiramate\n\nExplanation: 'Sumatriptan is the drug of choice for acute severe migraine but it is not indicated for prophylaxis'.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nWhich of the following antimicrobials needs dose reduction even in mild renal failure?\n* Ciprofloxacin\n* Carbenicillin\n* Cefotaxime (Correct Answer)\n* Ethambutol\n\nExplanation: Ethambutol (E) Ethambutol is selectively tuberculostatic and clinically as active as S. Fast multiplying bacilli are more susceptible as are many atypical mycobacteria. Added to the triple drug regimen ofRHZ it has been found to hasten the rate of sputum conversion and to prevent development of resistance. The mechanism of action of E is not fulhunderstood, but it has been found to inhibit arabinosyl transferases involved in arabinogalactan synthesis and to interfere with mycolic acid incorporation in mycobacterial cell walL Resistance to E develops slowly; in many cases it is due to alteration in the drug target gene. I\\o cross resistance with any other antitubercular drug has been noted. About 3 I 4 of an oral dose of E is absorbed. It is distributed widely but penetrates meninge5 incompletely and is temporarily stored in RBCs Less than liz of E is metabolized. It is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; plasma halflife is 4 hrs. Caution is required in its use in patients with renal disease. Patient acceptability of E is very good and side effects are few. Loss of visual acuity I colour vision. field defects due to optic neuritis is the most impoant dose and duration of therapy dependent toxicity. Because young children ma,be unable to repo early visual impairment, it should not be used below 6 years of age. With early recognition and stoppage of therapy, visual toxicity is largely reversible. Ethambutol produces few other symptoms: nausea, rashes, fever, neurological changes are infrequent. Hyperuricemia is due to interference with urate excretion. It a commonly used antitubercular drug.Ethambutol hydrochloride, following a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight, attains a peak of 2 to 5 mcg/mL in serum 2 to 4 hours after administration. When the drug is administered daily for longer periods of time at this dose, serum levels are similar. The serum level of Ethambutol falls to undetectable levels by 24 hours after the last dose except in some patients with abnormal renal function. The intercellular concentrations of erythrocytes reach peak values approximately twice those of plasma and maintain this ratio throughout the 24 hours.

Cytarabine It is phosphorylated in the body to the corresponding nucleotide which inhibits DNA synthesis. The triphosphate of cytarabine is an inhibitor of DNA polymerase and blocks generation of cytidilic acid. However, it is now believed that its incorporation into DNA is more impoant for the expression of cellular toxicity. It also interferes with DNA repair. Cytarabine is cell cycle specific and acts primarily during S phase. Its main use is to induce remission in acute leukaemia in children, also in adults. Other uses are-Hodgkin&;s disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both 5-FU and cytarabine exe primary toxicity on bone marrow and g.i.t. Genetic deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) predisposes to severe 5-FU toxicity. High-dose therapy (2,000-3,000 mg/m2) has been associated with severe and potentially fatal toxicities which differ from those seen with usual low doses. Ocular toxicities may include vision loss, reversible corneal toxicity (keratitis), and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (<80%).2,3,6 Ocular toxicities have been repoed 1-2 weeks after initiating therapy.Symptoms may include tearing, eye pain, foreign body sensation, photophobia, and blurred vision. Conjunctivitis may occur with rash. Toxicity can be minimized by prophylactic use of ophthalmic coicosteroids.2Use prednisolone 0.12% - 1% or dexamethasone 0.1%, 2 drops in each eye every 4 hours, beginning before the first dose of cytarabine and continuing until 48 hours after the last one. NS may also help relieve symptoms. Neurotoxicity (8-10%) typically occurs 3-8 days after initiating therapy. Cerebellar dysfunction is characterized by difficulty with speech, trouble standing or walking, and tremors. Cerebral dysfunction may be seen concomitantly and is characterized by somnolence, confusion, personality changes, cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, psychosis, or seizures. Seizures are usually self-limited. In most patients, neurologic dysfunction resolves in 5-10 days. There is a high incidence (~60%) of recurrent cerebellar toxicity in patients who have already experienced toxicity. It is not conclusively known if cytarabine therapy should be discontinued if neurological toxicity develops.

(B) Blood level below 350 mg/ml should be maintained to avoid agranulocytosis(Ref: Drug Facts and Comparisons 2006/1205-1206; Goodman Gilman 12th/427,432)High plasma concentration of Clozapine increases the risk of seizures (not agranulocytosis). However, usual plasma concentration required in many persons is 300-600 ng/ml.Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has high potency to block 5HT2 receptors as compared to D2 receptors. It has high potency to block D2 as compared to D1 receptors.It should not be used with Carbamazepine due to two reasons:Carbamazepine induces its metabolism and thus decreases the plasma concentration.Carbamazepine has bone marrow suppressant action and can add to agranulocytosis caused by Clozapine.Clozapine should be started at low doses (12.5 mg) and gradually dose should be increased. Baseline WBC counts should be measured and then weekly counts should be done atleast for first 6 months. When WBC count becomes less than 3000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count becomes less than 1500/mm3, Clozapine should be discontinued. After discontinuation, weekly WBC counts should be less than 2000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count below 1000/mm3 should not be started on Clozapine again.\n\n## Question from Pharmacology:\nIndirect Coomb&;s test detects:\n* Antibodies attached to RBC Surface (Correct Answer)\n* Antibodies in the serum\n* Antigens attached to RBC Surface\n* Antigens in the serum\n\nExplanation: Indirect Coomb&;s test detects IgG antibodies in the serum (e.g. Anti-D Antibodies).

A detailed PET scan study of his cerebral coex might be expected to show\n* Expansion of the right hand area in his right somatic sensory area I (SI)\n* Expansion of the right hand area in his left SI\n* Projection of fibre from neighboring sensory areas into the right hand area of his right SI. (Correct Answer)\n* Projection of fibers from neighbouring sensory areas into the right hand area of his left SI\n\nExplanation: Between 50% and 80% of amputees experience phantom sensations, usually pain, in the region of their amputated limb. Phantom sensations may also occur after the removal of body pas other than the limbs, for example, after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain), or removal of an eye (phantom eye syndrome). Numerous theories have been evoked to explain this phenomenon. The current theory is based on evidence that the brain can reorganize if sensory input is cut off. The ventral posterior thalamic nucleus is one example where this change can occur. In patients who have had their leg amputated, single neuron recordings show that the thalamic region that once received input from the leg and foot now respond to stimulation of the stump (thigh).(Reference: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 176)\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nWhich of the following does not form filtration barrier in nephrons:\n* Podocytes\n* Endothelial cells (Correct Answer)\n* Mesangium\n* Basement membrane (basal lamina)\n\nExplanation: Ans. C. Mesangiuma. Two cellular layers separate the blood from glomerular filtrate in Bowman's capsule, Capillaryb. endothelium and specialized endothelium.c. These two layers are separated by aBASAL LAMINA.d. Stellate cells called mesangial cells send their processes between endothelium and basal lamina.e.

The pain receptors in the skin and other tissues are all free nerve endings. They are widespread in the superficial layers of the skin, as well as in ceain internal tissues, such as the periosteum, the aerial walls, the joint surfaces, and the falx and tentorium in the cranial vault.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nThe most common cause of the congenital heart defect is:\n* A viral infection in mother during first trimester (Correct Answer)\n* A bacterial infection in mother during first trimester\n* Consumption of NSAIDs by mother during first trimester\n* None of the above\n\nExplanation: Congenital heart disease is not uncommon, occurring in about 8 of every 1000 live births.\nOne of the most common causes of congenital heart defects is a viral infection in the mother during the first trimester of pregnancy, when the fetal heart is being formed.\nDefects are particularly prone to develop when the expectant mother contracts German measles; thus, obstetricians may advise termination of pregnancy, if German measles occurs in the first trimester.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nNa/K pump which enzyme is used -\n* ATPase (Correct Answer)\n* GTPase\n* Acetyl CoA\n* None of these\n\nExplanation: Sodium-potassium pump is the most important pump for primary active transport Q in the body.\nNa + -K + pump is an electrogenic pump Q that is responsible for maintaining the Na + and K + concentration difference across the cell membrane.\nNa + - K + pump extrudes 3 Na + out from the cell and at the same time pump 2K + into the cell Q , i.e., Coupling ratio of Na + K + pump is 3 : 2 Q . Na + and K + transport by Na + - K + pump is primary active transport Q and both Na + and K + are transported against concentration gradient Q\n(intracellular fluid has high concentration of K + and ECF has high concentration of Na - ).\nNa + K + pump uses energy by hydrolysing ATP; this pump contains ATPase activity Q.\n\nNa + - K + pump is a carrier protein which is a heterodimer 0 made up of two separate globular proteins: a larger one called α-subunit with a molecular weight of 100,000 and a smaller one called β-subunit, with a molecular weight of about 55,000. Both α- and β- subunits span across the membrane with intracellular and extracellular sites. \nNa + and K + transport occurs through a-subunits.\n\nIntracellular portion of a-subunit has three Na + binding sites (three receptor sites for Na + ), an ATP binding site, a phosphorylating site and ATPase activity Q.\nExtracellular portion Q has two K + binding sites (two receptor sites for K + ), and an ouabain binding site Q.\nThe β- subunit has three extracellular glycosylation sites Q, all of which appear to have attached carbohydrate residue.\n\nThe Na + - K + pump is an electrogenic pump Q since it produces a net movement of positive charge out of the cell.\n\nThus, besides maintaining the ionic composition of the intracellular fluid, the Na + - K + pump helps to maintain the electrochemical potential difference across the cell membrane.\nHowever, Na + - K + pump contributes only 4 millivolts to the total resting membrane potential of 90 volts which is almost negligible Q.\n\nActive transport of Na+ and K+ - is one of the major energy-using processes in the body.\n\nOn average, it accounts for about 24% of the energy utilized by cell and in neurons, it accounts for 70%. o Activity of Na+ - K+ pump is stimulated by the increased intracellular concentration of Na +,\nthyroid hormones, aldosterone and insulin. Pump activity is inhibited by CHF, CRF, digoxin toxicity and dopamine.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nBilateral cutting of vagus nerve causes ?\n* Decrease hea rate\n* Decrease respiratory rate (Correct Answer)\n* Increase hea rate\n* Decreased BP\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Increase hea rate Aoic nerve (a branch of vagus nerve) carries :? i) Baroreceptor afferent from Aoic sinus. ii) Chemoreceptor afferent from Aoic bodies. Bilateral sectioning of vagus nerve causes increase in hea rate and BP due to two reasons :? i) Abolition of baroreceptor discharge of aoic sinus on RVLM - causing increasing in sympathetic output. ii) Inhibition of nucleus ambiguous - causing decreased parasympathetic tone. Effect on chemoreceptors afferent is minimal as chemoreceptors are stimulate by low PO, and normally they have no dischange.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nMost important function of albumin in body is\n* Oncotic pressure (Correct Answer)\n* Drug transport\n* Toxic transport\n* Coagulation\n\nExplanation: Osmotic pressure is determined by the number of molecules dissolved in a fluid rather than by the mass of these molecules. Therefore, when corrected for number of molecules rather than mass, the following chart gives both the relative mass concentrations (g/dl) of the different types of proteins in normal plasma and their respective contributions to the total plasma colloid osmotic pressure (Πp).\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nMain enzyme involved in digestion of fatty food-\n* Lingual lipase\n* Gastric lipase (Correct Answer)\n* Pancreatic lipase\n* Phospholipase\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Pancreatic lipase o Ebner's glands on the dorsum of the tongue secrete lingual lipase and the stomach also secretes a lipase (gastric lipase}.o However, they are of very little significance in fat digestion.o Fat digestion essentially begins in the duodenum with entry of pancreatic and biliary secretions.o Pancreatic juice contains lipase (pancreatic lipase), the most important enzyme for fat digestion.o The pancreatic lipase digests triglycerides (triacylglycerois) into free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides (2- monocyiglycerols).o Pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes 1-and 3-bonds of triglycerides with relative sparing of 2-bonds, so the principal products of its action are free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nWhich hormone increases with age?\n* GH\n* Prolactin (Correct Answer)\n* Parathormone\n* Insiilfn\n\nExplanation: Parathyroid hormone (PTH), also called parathormone or parathyrin, is a hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands that are impoant in bone remodeling, which is an ongoing process in which bone tissue is alternately resorbed and rebuilt over time.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology: 24th\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nThe blood pressure regulatory system that is labeled as a buffer system is\n* Baroreceptor (Correct Answer)\n* Chemoreceptor\n* Kidney\n* CNS ischemic response\n\nExplanation: Baroreceptor system opposes either increases or decreases in aerial pressure, it is called a pressure buffer system, and the nerves from the baroreceptors are called buffer nerves.Ref: Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology 13th edition. Page: 221\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nWhich of the following muscles plays an impoant role in lifting the left foot off the ground while walking?\n* Left gluteus medius\n* Left gluteus maximus\n* Right adductor longus (Correct Answer)\n* Right gluteus medius\n\nExplanation: The right gluteus medius and the right gluteus minimus lift the pelvis so that the left lower limb is raised, thus permitting the left foot to be advanced forward clear of the ground.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nG protein coupled receptor ?\n* NMDA receptor\n* Steroid (Correct Answer)\n* M2\n* Insulin receptors\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., M2M2 muscarinic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors and act through cAMP.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nWhich neurotransmitter is responsible for anterograde dilatation of the small intestine?\n* image_question (Correct Answer)\n* image_question\n* image_question\n* image_question\n\nExplanation: VIP is responsible for antergrade dilatation of the small intestine. Cholinergic neurons passing inn antegrade direction produce NO and VIP which cause relaxation of a segment of the intestine in front of the bolus. Cholinergic neurons passing in retrograde direction produce substance P and acetylcholine which cause contraction of a segment of the intestine behind the bolus.

PaintalThese receptors are located very close to the pulmonary capillaries (Juxtapulmonary receptors) in pulmonary interstitium\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nContractility of cardiac muscle depends on\n* On T tubules (Correct Answer)\n* On T tubules and extracellular Ca2+\n* On extracellular Ca2+\n* On intracellular Ca2+\n\nExplanation: Excitation and contraction coupling is there in cardiac muscle. When an action potential reaches the T tubules there is activation of Dihydropyridine channels. This causes influx of extracellular calcium into sarcoplasm. Ref: Textbook of medical physiology by N Geetha, 2nd edition, page no. 53\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nCapacitance vessels have in their wall ?\n* More elastic tissue and less muscle\n* Less elastic tissue and more muscle\n* More elastic tissue and more muscle (Correct Answer)\n* Less elastic tissue and less muscle\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., Less elastic tissue and less muscleVeins are capacitance vessels. They have less smooth muscle and less elastic tissue in their wall.Structure of vessels A) Structure of aeryIt is made up three layers -1.Tunica IntimaThe inner most layer (towards lumen) of aery is intima.It consists of endothelial cells which rest on basment membrane.There is some subendothelial connective tissue.Intima is separated from media by internal elastic lamina.2.Tunica MediaIt is mainly contains smooth muscles and laminae of elastic tissue Media is separated from adventitia by external elastic lamina.3.Tunica AdventitiaIt is the outer most layer.Contains collegen and elastic fibers.B) Structure of capillariesCapillaries are thin walled vessels made up of single layer of endothelial cells with its basement membrane. o Capillaries are of three types -1.Continous capillaries -These capillaries has continuous lining of endothelial cells with no fenestration.Basement membrane is also continuous.2.Fenesterated capillariesThere are fenestration between the endothelial cells.Basment membrane is continuous.3.Sinusoidal capillariesBoth endothelial cells and basement membrane have fenestration.In resting tissues, most of the capillaries are collapsed and blood flows through the throughfare vessels from the aerioles to the venules.C) Structure of veinsStructure of vein is smiliar to aery except that -1.Wall is thinner2.Three tunicae are less well demarcated.3.Elastic tissue is scanty and not clearly organized into distinct internal and external elastic lamina.4.Have valves (except venae cavae and common iliac vein).\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nOsmotic pressure of 1 mol of ideal solute relative to pure water is:\n* 2.5 atm\n* 5.2 atm (Correct Answer)\n* 22.4 atm\n* 15.2 atm\n\nExplanation: 1 mol of an ideal solute dissolved in 1000g of water (a 1m or molal solution) at 1 atm pressure yield a solution whose osmotic pressure relative to pure water is 22.4atm (250C). Ref: Principles of Medical Physiology by Sabyasachi Sircar, 2008/2-22\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nAbout Enterohepatic circulation, FALSE is\n* Na+ Bile salt cotranspoer is involved.\n* 95% bile salts are reabsorbed (Correct Answer)\n* All the components of bile are reabsorbed.\n* Occurs 6-8 times daily\n\nExplanation: Bile is made up of the bile acids, bile pigments, and other substances dissolved in an alkaline electrolyte solution that resembles pancreatic juice. About 500 mL is secreted per day. Some of the components of the bile especially bile salts are reabsorbed in the intestine and then excreted again by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). 90 to 95% of the bile acids are absorbed from the small intestine. Once they are deconjugated, they can be absorbed by nonionic diffusion, but most are absorbed in their conjugated forms from the terminal ileum by an extremely efficient Na+-bile salt cotranspo system (ABST) whose activity is secondarily driven by the low intracellular sodium concentration established by the basolateral Na+, K+ ATPase. The total bile acid pool of approximately 3.5 g recycles repeatedly the enterohepatic circulation; it has been calculated that the entire pool recycles twice per meal and 6-8 times per day.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nA 34-year-old female presents with hypertension, pinched facies and progressive dysphagia with decreased tone of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) The clinical diagnosis is?\n* Scleroderma (Correct Answer)\n* Hiatus hernia\n* Rolling hernia\n* Diffuse esophageal spasm\n\nExplanation: Ans. A SclerodermaRef: CMDT 2019 page 323* Pinched facies with hypertension points to presence of scleroderma. The tone of LES is reduced in scleroderma due to fibrosis.* Choice B and C can lead to GERD but it does not have other features like systemic hypertension.* Choice D presents with chest pain and dysphagia and is hence ruled out.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nTrue about Macula Densa is/are:\n* Also known as Tubulo glomerular feedback.\n* Macula densa senses change in NaCl concentration.\n* For autoregulation of GFR. (Correct Answer)\n* All of the above.\n\nExplanation: Function of Macula Densa (Tubulo glomerular feedback): \n\nMacula densa senses change in NaCl concentration. \nFor autoregulation of GFR.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nThe stimulation of which of the following causes hyperventilation at high altitude\n* Peripheral chemoreceptors (Correct Answer)\n* Vagal afferents\n* Central chemoreceptors\n* Proprioceptors\n\nExplanation: The composition of air stays the same, but the total barometric pressure falls with increasing altitude. Therefore, the PO2 also falls. At 3000 m (approximately 10,000 ft) above sea level, the alveolar PO2 is about 60 mm Hg and there is enough hypoxic stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors to definitely increase ventilation. As one ascends higher, the alveolar PO2 falls less rapidly and the alveolar PCO2 declines somewhat because of the hyperventilation. The resulting fall in aerial PCO2 produces respiratory alkaloids.Ref: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 617\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nPleural pressure at the end of respiration is ?\n* Zero (Correct Answer)\n* More negative\n* Positive\n* Less negative\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., More negativeDuring quiet breathing, the intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3 and -6 mm Hg, depending upon the phase of respiration, more negative at the end of inspiration and less negative during expiration.Intrapleural pressure (Pleural pressure)It is the pressure between two pleural surfaces. The lung is covered with visceral pleura and the thoracic cage is lined on inside with parietal pleura. Between the two layers of pleura is a very narrow space, called the pleural cavity. Intrapleural pressure is always negative and during quiet breathing the Intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3.8 mm Hg (- 5.0 cm watery to -6.0 mm Hg (-8.0 cm water).Now let us examine why the pleural pressure is negative; more negative during inspiration, less negative during expiraion, but always negative during quiet breathing. The key to the answer is the fact that both the thoracic cage and lungs are elastic structures. Being elastic structure they both tend to recoil, but in opposite direction. The lungs have a tendency to collapse and thoracic cage has a tendency to expand. However, because of the anatomical relationships in the body, these tendencies do not normally materialize. But the tendencies do create an inward pull on the visceral pleura (by lung) and an outward pull on parietal pleura (by thoracic cage). The results of these pulls is a negative pressure in the space between the pleural surfaces, i.e., in the pleural cavity.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nMuscles that are best suited for brief high-intensity exercise would contain which of the following types of fibres?\n* Glycolytic (white)\n* Slow-twitch oxidative (red)\n* A mix of slow twitch (red) and fast twicth (red) (Correct Answer)\n* A mix of glycolytic (white) and fast twitch (red)\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nThe renal threshold for glucose is:\n* 180 mg / dl (Correct Answer)\n* 100 mg /dl\n* 120 mg / dl\n* 80 mg / dl\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nA patient suffers a severe haemorrhage resulting in a lowered mean aerial pressure. Which of the following would be elevated above normal levels\n* Splanchnic blood flow\n* Cardiopulmonary receptor activity\n* Right ventricular end-diastolic volume (Correct Answer)\n* Hea rate\n\nExplanation: The hea rate would be elevated by the increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity caused by the baroreceptor reflex.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nAll are true about exocrine functions of pancreas EXCEPT:\n* Osmolality is 1/2 of the osmolality of blood (Correct Answer)\n* Osmolality is 1/2 of the osmolality of blood\n* Secretin enhances bicarbonate secretion\n* Secretion is rich in enzymes.\n\nExplanation: A i.e. Osmolality is 1/2 of the osmolality of blood\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nThe mechanism involved in the absorption of glucose from the small intestine is\n* Passive diffusion\n* Facilitated diffusion (Correct Answer)\n* Secondary active cotranspo with sodium\n* Actively by insulin dependent uptake\n\nExplanation: Hexoses are rapidly absorbed across the wall of the small intestine. Essentially all the hexoses are removed before the remains of a meal reach the terminal pa of the ileum. The sugar molecules pass from the mucosal cells to the blood in the capillaries draining into the poal vein. The transpo of most hexoses is dependent on Na+ in the intestinal lumen; a high concentration of Na+ in the mucosal surface of the cells facilitates and a low concentration inhibits sugar influx into the epithelial cells. This is because glucose and Na+share the same cotranspoer,or sympo,the sodium-dependent glucose transpoer (SGLT, Na+glucose cotranspoer) The members of this family of transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, resemble the glucose transpoers responsible for facilitated diffusion.in that they cross the cell membrane 12 times and have their -COOH and -NH2 terminals on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, there is no homology to the glucose transpoer (GLUT) series of transpoers. SGLT-1 is responsible for uptake of dietary glucose from the gut. The related transpoer, SGLT 2, is responsible for glucose transpo out of the renal tubules. Because the intracellular Na+concentration is low in intestinal cells as it is in other cells, Na+moves into the cell along its concentration gradient. Glucose moves with the Na+ and is released in the cell. The Na+is transpoed into the lateral intercellular spaces, and the glucose is transpoed by GLUT 2 into the interstitium and thence to the capillaries. Thus, glucose transpo is an example of secondary active transpo, the energy for glucose transpo is provided indirectly, by the active transpo of Na+ out of the cell. This maintains the concentration gradient across the luminal border of the cell so that more Na+and consequently more glucose enter. When the Na+glucose cotranspoer is congenitally defective, the resulting glucose/galactose malabsorption causes severe diarrhea that is often fatal if glucose and galactose are not promptly removed from the diet.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:453\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nSkeletal framework of a cell is maintained by\n* Nucleus (Correct Answer)\n* Microtubules\n* Ribosomes\n* Mitochondtia\n\nExplanation: It is a pa of cytoskeleton Microtubules are major components of the cytoskeleton. They are found in all eukaryotic cells, and they are involved in mitosis, cell motility, intracellular transpo, and maintenance of cell shape.

The mechanism is called Myogenic autoregulation of renal blood flow and GFR. Stretch of the vascular wall allows increased movement of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid into the cells, causing them to contract. This contraction prevents excessive stretch of the vessel. This prevents excessive increase of renal blood flow and GFR by raising vascular resistance. This mechanism may be more impoant in protecting the kidney from hypeension-induced injury. Autoregulation has two main mechanisms: Metabolic mechanism: Tissues produce vasodilatory metabolites that regulate flow E.g., Addenosine, prostaglandins, NO, CO2, H+ and K+. Myogenic mechanism.

Fibers from the annulospiral endings of muscle spindles (about 17 microns in diameter on average; these fibers are a-type A fibers in the general classification).Group Ib. Fibers from the Golgi tendon organs (about 16 micrometers in diameter on average; these fibers also are a-type A fibers).Group II. Fibers from most discrete cutaneous tactile receptors and from the flower-spray endings of the muscle spindles (about 8 micrometers in diameter on average; these fibers are b- and g-type A fibers in the general classification).Group III. Fibers carrying temperature, crude touch, and pricking pain sensations (about 3 micrometers in diameter on average; they are d-type A fibers in the general classification).Group IV. Unmyelinated fibers carrying pain, itch, temperature, and crude touch sensations (0.5 to 2 micrometers in diameter; they are type C fibers in the general classification).Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Chapter 47; Sensory Receptors, Neuronal Circuits for Processing Information\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nWhich cerebellar component would be abnormal in a degenerative disease that affected spinal sensory neurons?\n* Purkinje cells (Correct Answer)\n* Mossy fibers\n* Parallel fibers\n* Climbing fibers\n\nExplanation: Ans. B. Mossy fibersSpinal input, such as from the spinocerebellar tracts, enters the cerebellum on the mossy fibers. The climbing fibers originate from the inferior olivary nucleus of the medulla (the olivo-cerebellar tract). The other components are intrinsic to the cerebellum.Diagram of neural connections in the cerebellum. Plus (+) and minus (-) signs indicate whether endings are excitatory or inhibitory.

When the GFR increases and causes in the tubular fluid at the macula densa to rise, more NaCl enters the macula densa cells. This leads to an increase in the formation and release of ATP and adenosine, a metabolite of ATP, by macula densa cells, which causes vasoconstriction of the afferent aeriole. Vasoconstriction of the afferent aeriole returns the GFR to normal levels.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nAll of the following increase small intestinal motility except\n* Secretin (Correct Answer)\n* Gastroenteric reflex\n* CCK\n* Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Secretin inhibits small intestinal motility. Factors that increase the peristaltic activity of small intestine Hormonal- Gastrin, CCK, insulin, motilin and serotonin Neural - Duodenal distension by chyme, gastroenteric reflex, gastroileal reflexes, parasympathetic (ACh) stimulation. Factors that decrease the peristaltic activity of small intestin: Hormone- Secretin and glucagon Neural- Sympathetic stimulation Gastroileal reflex- On reaching the ileocecal valve, the chyme is sometimes blocked for several hours until the person eats another meal. At that time, a gastroileal reflex intensifies peristalsis in the ileum and forces the remaining chyme through the ileocecal valve into the cecum of the large intestine. Ref: Guyton and Hall 13th edition Pgno: 813\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nA high plasma renin activity (PRA) is expected in patients\n* With sodium overload\n* Presently taking a beta blocker (Correct Answer)\n* Taking an angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitor\n* With Conn syndrome\n\nExplanation: A high plasma renin activity (PRA) is present in patients who are taking angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors.Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that is synthesized and stored in the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, which consists of the juxtaglomerular cells (specialized myoepithelial cells) and the cells of the macula densa, located in the distal tubule. The JG cells surround the afferent aerioles of glomeruli in the kidneys. Once released, renin acts on angiotensinogen, which is synthesized in the liver, and conves it into the decapeptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then enzymatically transformed into angiotensin II (All), an octapeptide, by conveing enzymes located in the kidney and the pulmonary vascular endothelium in the lungs. AII is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that directly acts on aeriolar smooth cells in the resistance vessels. In addition, it stimulates the efferent aerioles in the kidneys and has a negative feedback on renin release. All, along with the nonapeptide AIII, also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal coex. Aldosterone enhances the distal and early collecting tubule reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium and/or hydrogen ions.An angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitor, such as captopril, increases PRA because it is the negative feedback inhibition of All on renin release. This treatment is used to test for stimulation of renin release, paicularly in renovascular hypeension, in which there is an exaggerated increase in PRA.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nVentilation perfusion ratio is:\n* 0.5 (Correct Answer)\n* 0.8\n* 1\n* 1.2\n\nExplanation: On an average, ventilation perfusion ratio is 0.8.

(Correct Answer)\n* Alpha chain has more affinity for O2 than beta chain\n* Beta chain has more affinity for than alpha chain\n* Hemoglobin in acidic in nature.\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e. Binding of one O2 molecule increases the affinity for next Hb also .Lehninger writes : \"Hemoglobin must bind oxygen efficiently in lungs and release oxygen in the tissues, myoglobin, or any protein that binds oxygen with a hyperbolic binding curve, would be ill-suited to this function. A protein that binds O2 with high affinity would bind it efficiency in the lungs but would not release much of it in the tissues. If the protein oxygen with a sufficiently low affinity to release it easily in the tissues, it would not pick up much of oxygen in lungs.Haemoglobin solves this problem by undergoing a transition from a low affinity state (the *T state) to a high affinity state (the (R state) as more oxygen molecules are bound. As a result, the Haemoglobin hos a hybrids-shaped, or sigmoid*, binding curve for oxygen*. \"\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nIn EEG the frequency 8-10 hz and amplitude 50-100 (pv)\n* Alpha (Correct Answer)\n* Beta\n* Theta\n* Delta\n\nExplanation: (Alpha): (273Ganong 24th edition; 1015- A.K.

If pregnancy does not follow ovulation, the corpus luteum degenerates within one or two weeks (periodic, or menstrual, corpus luteum) ; if, however, the ovum is feilized and pregnancy begins, the corpus luteum grows very rapidly (corpus luteum of pregnancy) and is retained throughout the greater pa of pregnancy, secreting the hormone progesterone, which is necessary for the maintenance and development of the pregnancy.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology; 24th edition; page no:-401\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nThe medial geniculate body is an eminence on the inferior surface of the thalamus lateral to the midbrain. Which of the following function is related to medial geniculate body?\n* Vision (Correct Answer)\n* Hearing\n* Balance\n* Smell\n\nExplanation: The medial geniculate body receives input independently from the cochlear nuclei (hearing). Projections then continue on to the primary superior temporal convolution (transverse gyrus of Heschl). Lateral geniculate body is concerned with vision.

A. LengthFunctions of Muscle spindlea. Sensing and Maintaining normal muscle length (By Length servo and Follow up servo mechanism)b. Stretch Reflexc. Muscle tone (Due to Gamma efferent discharge)d. Body Posture (Postural reflex at spinal cord level)So both stretch and length are functions of muscle spindle but the primary function is maintenance of length.Pneumonic: Golgi tendon organ is for tension (t for tension, t for tendon) Muscle spindle is for length\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nAccording to Frank-Starling law, extent of the preload is proportional to\n* Increase heart rate (Correct Answer)\n* End-diastolic volume\n* End.systolic volume\n* Ejection systolic volume\n\nExplanation: i.e. (End-diastolic volume): (515-Ganong 23rd) (181-82- AK jain 4th)Starling's law of the heart or Frank-Starling lawThe length of the cardiac muscle fibers (i.e. the extent of the preload) is proportional to the end, diastolic volume (EDV)\"Energy of contraction is proportional to the initial length of the cardiac muscle fiber\"The relation between ventricular stroke volume and end diastolic volume is called the Frank-Sterling curveEDV measures the 'passive' tension i.e. diastolic intraventricular pressureSignificance of Frank-Starling Law(I) The law helps up to explain that blood ejected by each of the ventricle per heart beat is the same. If RV out put per beat exceeds LV output. This will cause accumulation of blood in LV; the Frank Starling law begins to operate causing more complete evacuation of LV. Thus the out put of two ventricles becomes the same again(II) It is a life saving device in cardiac failure. How? LVF causes accumulation of blood within LV thereby decreases blood supply to vital organs. However accumulation of blood in LV initiates operation of Frank Starling mechanism leading to greater output by LV If accumulation of blood is too great, the Frank Starling law will fail to operate, decreasing blood supply to vital organs and finally leads to death.* During diastole, filling of the ventricles normally increases the volume of each ventricles to about 110 to 120 ml, this volume is known as end-diastolic volume\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nCyanosis does not occur in severe anaemia because\n* Hypoxia stimulates erythropoietin production\n* Oxygen carrying capacity of available haemoglobin is increased (Correct Answer)\n* Critical conc.

If hemolysis in the fetus is severe, the infant may die in utero or may develop anemia, severe jaundice, and edema (hydrops fetalis). Kernicterus, a neurologic syndrome in which unconjugated bilirubin is deposited in the basal ganglia, may also develop, especially if bih is complicated by a period of hypoxia. Unlike IgM, IgG is able to cross the placenta.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nPulmonary vascular resistance is reduced by:\n* Removal of one lung\n* Breathing a 10% oxygen mixture\n* Exhaling from functional residual capacity to residual volume (Correct Answer)\n* Acutely increasing pulmonary venous pressure\n\nExplanation: Acutely increasing pulmonary venous pressure will raise capillary pressure and result in recruitment and distension of the capillaries. The other choices are incorrect because removing one lung greatly reduces the vascular bed, 10% oxygen breathing results in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, reducing lung volume to residual volume increases the resistance of the extra-alveolar vessels, and mechanically ventilating the lung with positive pressure increases the alveolar pressure and therefore tends to compress the capillaries.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nThyroid hormone receptor which is predominantly expressed in CNS/Brain ?\n* a - 1\n* a - 2 (Correct Answer)\n* b-1\n* b-2\n\nExplanation: Ans. is'c'i.e., b-1There are three forms of thyroid hormone receptor that are able to bind thyroid hormone.TR - alpha 1+ Widely expressed with high expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle.TR- beta 1-+ Predominantly expressed in brain, liver and kidney.TR- beta 2-+ Expression primarily limited to hypothalamus & pituitary.Fouh isotypes TR- alpha2, is also widely expressed but is unable to bind thyroid hormone.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nAll are true regarding smell sence EXCEPT\n* Rapid adapting (Correct Answer)\n* Affects the larger area\n* The olfactory receptor cell is a bipolar neuron\n* Threshold of the smell is low-\n\nExplanation: B. i.e. (Affects the larger area) (185- 86 - Ganong 22nd) (219-22-Ganong 23rd)SMELL - In dogs and other animals in which the sense of smell is highly developed (Macrosmatic animals) thearea covered by olfactory mucous membrane is larger; in Microsmatic animals such as humans it is small*** Olfactory receptors are phasic receptors and adapt very rapidly within first second the adaptation occurs upto 50%.* The olfactory receptor cell is a bipolar neuron. The dendrite of this neuron is short* Methyl mercaptan produces olfactory sensation even at a low concentration of 0.0000004 mg/L of air (Low threshold for olfactory stimulation)* Adaptation to the smell of odoriferous substances is called olfactory fatigue. An odour (foul or pleasant) which at first is quite clearly perceptible, gradually disappears and becomes imperceptible. It develops within second or minute, depending on the nature of the substances* The degree of adaptation can be measured by the rise in threshold concentration required to excite the sense of smell (1091 -A.K.

The parvocellular pathway, from layers 3-6, carries signals for color vision, texture, shape, and fine detail. The parvocellular pathway also carries color opponent data to the deep pa of layer 4.Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, Twenty-Third Edition\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nSharp stabbing pain is carried by which type of fibers -\n* Aa (Correct Answer)\n* Ad\n* B\n* C\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., A5 * Pain is carried by two types of neurons :a) Ad fibers : Fast fibers carrying sharp well localized pain.b) C fibers: Poorly localized dull and acting pain.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nA pilot in Sukhoi aircraft is experiencing negative G. Which of the following physiological events will manifest in such situation?\n* The hydrostatic pressure in veins of lower limb increases\n* The cardiac output decreases\n* Black out occurs (Correct Answer)\n* The cerebral arterial pressure rises\n\nExplanation: In negative gravity, the blood will no longer be held onto lower limbs. So lower limb venous pressure decrease and the venous return increases. This will cause the cardiac output to increase. Since no gravity, blood rushes to the head, and cause increased cerebral arterial pressure and red outs (mental confusion).\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nPacemaker potential occurs due to\n* Opening of transient, rapid T-type Ca2+ channel (Correct Answer)\n* Opening of K+ channel\n* Closure of Ca2+ channel\n* Closure of funny Na+  channel\n\nExplanation: Pacemaker potential occurs due to\n\nOpening of slow type funny Na+ channel\nOpening of transient, rapid T-type Ca2+ channel\nEarly closure of K+ channel\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nAll of the following have inhibitory effect on secretion of gastric, except-\n* Acid in duodenum\n* VIP (Correct Answer)\n* Epinephrine\n* Glucagon\n\nExplanation: Ans.

Basal metabolic rate is related to both Body surface area and Lean body mass. However it appears to be more closely related to Lean body mass. Lean body mass is the total mass of the body minus the fat. Total daily energy expenditure is made up of resting energy expenditure and activity energy expenditure. Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) = BMR + thermal effect of food Activity Energy Expenditure (AEE) is the energy expended by the body in movement including both energy dependent in sedentary or obligatory activities and that expended in discretionary activity. It makes up 20-40% of the total energy required.

But angiotensin II mainly acts on blood vessels, kidney and adrenal coex.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nOne oogonium gives how many ovum\n* 1 (Correct Answer)\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n\nExplanation: A primordial oocyte during fetal development; it is derived from a primordial germ cell and before bih becomes aprimary oocyte.no oogonia are present after bih.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology; 24th edition; page no: 401\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nOsmolarity of plasma is\n* 190 (Correct Answer)\n* 290\n* 390\n* 490\n\nExplanation: Plasma Osmolarity :it is a measure of hydration status.plasma Osmolarity changes during dehydration and rehydration. Plasma Osmolarity ranges from 280 to 300 mOs/kg Ref:Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology 12th edition ,pag number:45 46\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nVibrations are felt by -\n* Meissner's corpuscle\n* Merkel's disc (Correct Answer)\n* Pacinian corpuscle\n* Ruffini's end organ\n\nExplanation: Ans, is 'c' i.e., Pacinian corpuscle Tactile (touch! receptorso These are general exteroreceptors for epicritic senses. These are divided into superficial and deep receptors,o Superficial receptors are present in the epidermis or papillary layer of dermis. In glabrous (non hairy) skin these receptors are Merkel's disc (slowly adapting) and Meissner's corpuscle (rapidly adapting). In hairy skin there are hair follicle receptors.o Deep receptors are present in deeper dermis or in the subcutaneous tissues. The deep receptors are same in both hair and nonhairy skin and include Ruffini's end organ (slowly adapting) and Pacinian corpuscle (Rapidly adapting).o Touch, pressure and vibration are different forms of same sensation. Pressure is felt when the force applied on the skin is sufficient to reach the deep receptors, whereas touch is felt when the force is insufficent to reach the deep receptors, therefore detected by superficial receptors (Merkel's disc, meissner's corpuscle). Vibrations are rhythmic variations in pressure (i.e. rhymic variations of force that reaches the deep receptors). Whether a tactile receptor senses pressure or vibration depends on whether the receptor is slowly adapting or slowly adapingSlowly adapting (Ruffmi's end organ) Are meant to detect sustained pressure; they are useless for vibrations.Rapidly adapting (Pacinian corpuscle)Stop discharge in response to sustained pressure; they are useful only w hen the pressure fluctuates rapidly, i.e. during vibrations. The higher the rate of adaptation of a receptor, the greater is the vibration frequency it can detect.o Thus, tactile (touch) sensation can be divided intoA ) Superficial (generally considered as touch) Detec ted by Meissner 's corpuscle (delect texture of sur- face, Le. rough or smooth) and Merkel's disc (detect two point discrimination).B) DeepPressure (Deep touch)Detected by Ruffini's end organ.Vibrations Detected by Pacinian corpuscle\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nIn the following diagram, the curve \"X\" represents the normal relationship of alveolar ventilation with PaCO2 when PaO2 is 100 mmHg.

In the central nervous system, its function is mainly excitatory Ref : guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number:677,678,679\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nSmall nerve fibres carry all except\n* Cold\n* Heat (Correct Answer)\n* Position sense\n* Pain\n\nExplanation: (C) Position sense# SMALL FIBERS carry information regarding pain and temperature.> Abnormalities affecting these nerves cause alteration of pain and temperature perception and severe pain.> Because of the difficulty characterizing the discomfort, orthopedists, podiatrists, and rheumatologists may initially evaluate patients for arthritic disorders. Pain is described as burning, prickling, stabbing, jabbing, or tight band-like pressure.> Pain is initially localized to the toes but may spread to the legs and even the arms and hands.> Examination may be normal or reveal a \"stocking-glove\" distribution sensory loss.> Rarely, patients present with a more widespread or diffuse pain syndrome.> Small fiber disorders: Most commonly Diabetes; others-Amyloid, Autoimmune or Collagen vascular disorders; HIV; Chemotherapy (such as antiretroviral therapy); Alcohol; Fabry's or Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nAngiotensin II causes A/E:\n* Stimulates release of ADH\n* Increases thirst (Correct Answer)\n* Vasodilation\n* Stimulates aldosterone release\n\nExplanation: Ans. C. VasodilationActions of Angiotensin IIa. Angiotensin II binds to AT1 receptors in the zona glomerulosa which act via a G protein to activate phospholipase C. The resulting increase in protein kinase C fosters the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and facilitates the action of aldosterone synthase, resulting in increased secretion of aldosterone. Angiotensin II is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors in body.b. Angiotensin II increases thirst sensation through the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain, decreases the response of the baroreceptor reflex, and increases the desire for salt.c. It increases secretion of ADH in the posterior pituitary and secretion of ACTH in the anterior pituitary.d. It also potentiates the release of norepinephrine by direct action on postganglionic sympathetic fibers.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nCeruloplasmin binds\n* Iron (Correct Answer)\n* Copper\n* Zinc\n* Manganese\n\nExplanation: Ceruloplasmin -Transpo of copper(table no32-6).(REF: GANONG'S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY 23rd EDITION page no.532)\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nCardiac output increase in exercise by\n* Increase in heart rate (Correct Answer)\n* Increase in preload\n* Increase in afterload\n* Sympathetic stimulation\n\nExplanation: Ans: a (Increase in HR) Ref: Ganong 22nd ed/ p.632, 633In muscular exercise there is increase in sympathetic activity resulting in increased cardiac contractility and heart rate. Rise in heart rate is the major event that occur in normal individuals compared to increase in contractility, remember Cardiac output = HR X Stroke volumeTherefore, cardiac output increases in normal individuals at the cost of increase in heart rate.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nThe ratio of ions moving out of the cell to the no. of ions moving inside the cell via the na:k ATPase pump is?\n* 2:03\n* 3:01\n* 1:03 (Correct Answer)\n* 3:02\n\nExplanation: Ans. D. 3:2. (Ref Ganong 23rd/ Ch. 32).NA, K ATPASENa, K ATPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and uses the energy to extrude three Na+ from the cell and take two K+ into the cell for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. It is an electrogenic pump in that it moves three positive charges out of the cell for each two that it moves in, and it is therefore said to have a coupling ratio of 3:2. It is found in all parts of the body. Its activity is inhibited by ouabain and related digitalis glycosides used in the treatment of heart failure. It is a heterodimer made up of an alpha subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 and a beta subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 55,000. Both extend through the cell membrane. Separation of the subunits eliminates activity. The beta subunit is a glycoprotein, whereas Na+ and K+ transport occur through the alpha subunit. The beta subunit has a single membrane-spanning domain and three extracellular glycosylation sites, all of which appear to have attached carbohydrate residues. These residues account for one third of its molecular weight. The alpha subunit probably spans the cell membrane 10 times, with the amino and carboxyl terminals both located intracellularly. This subunit has intracellular Na+- and ATP-binding sites and a phosphorylation site; it also has extracellular binding sites for K+ and ouabain. The endogenous ligand of the ouabain-binding site is unsettled. When Na+ binds to the alpha subunit, ATP also binds and is converted to ADP, with a phosphate being transferred to Asp 376, the phosphorylation site. This causes a change in the configuration of the protein, extruding Na+ into the ECF. K+ then binds extracellularly, dephosphorylating the alpha subunit, which returns to its previous conformation, releasing K+ into the cytoplasm.Na+-K+ ATPase is located in the plasma membrane with ATP site on cytoplasmic side. For each ATP consumed, 3 Na+ go out and 2 K+ come in. During cycle, pump is phosphorylated.Ouabain inhibits by binding to K+ site.Cardiac glycosides (digoxin and digitoxin from foxglove) also inhibit the Na+-K+ ATPase, causing T cardiac contractility. Also know:The cells of the proximal and distal tubules, like the cells of the gastric glands, secrete hydrogen ions. Acidification also occurs in the collecting ducts. The reaction that is primarily responsible for H+ secretion in the proximal tubules is Na-H exchange. This is an example of secondary active transport; extrusion of Na+ from the cells into the interstitium by Na, K ATPase lowers intracellular Na+, and this causes Na+ to enter the cell from the tubular lumen, with coupled extrusion of H+ The H+ comes from intracellular dissociation of H2CO3, and the HCO3 that is formed diffuses into the interstitial fluid. Thus, for each H+ ion secreted, one Na+ ion and one HCO3 ion enter the interstitial fluid.Type of transportEnergy sourceExampleOther characteristicsClinical correlationSimple diffusionPassivePulmonary gases--Pulmonary edema decreases diffusionCarrier-mediated or facilitated diffusionPassiveGlucose uptake by muscleInsulin controls carrier population CHemical specificityInsulin-dependent glucose uptake impaired in diabetes mellitusPrimary active transportDirect use of ATPNa+/K+-ATPaseH+/K+-ATPaseAntiport (countertransport)Inhibition by cardiac glycosidesSecondary active transportElectrochemical gradient for sodium is most common driving forceNa+-glucose in kidneyNa+-H+ exchangeSymport (cotransport) Antiport (countertransport)Osmotic diuresis results when transporters saturated Renal tubular acidosis\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nTotal lung capacity depends on:\n* Size of airway\n* Closing tidal volume (Correct Answer)\n* Lung compliance\n* Residual volume\n\nExplanation: Ans. C. Lung compliancea. TLC is the maximum volume to which the lungs can be expanded with the greatest possible inspiratory effort.b. TLC=IRV+TV+ERV+RV=IC+RVc. Compliance (stretch ability) of lungs: D is increased in Emphysema (obstructive lungs dis) and decreased in Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (Restrictive lung disease). Compliance of lung is change in lung volume per unit change in airways pressure.d. TLC is increased in obstructive lung disease (eg. emphysema, COPD) and decreased in the restrictive lung disease (Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis).\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nPredict the effect of aldosterone hypersecretion on body fluid pH and electrolytes ?\n* pH decreased, K+ decreased, Na+ increased (Correct Answer)\n* pH increased, K+ decreased, Na+ increased\n* pH decreased, K+ increased, Na+ decreased\n* pH increased, K+ increased, Na+ decreased\n\nExplanation: Aldosterone increases the rate of sodium absorption and potassium secretion by the kidneys, but in high concentrations aldosterone also stimulates hydrogen ion secretion. Therefore elevated aldosterone levels such as occur in patients with Cushing's syndrome can elevate body fluid pH above normal (alkalosis). The major factor that influences the rate of hydrogen ion secretion, however, is pH of the body fluids. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 20.

But in practice we use creatinine clearance to measure GFR because it is easier to measure.PAHA is used to measure renal plasma flow i.e.Clearance of para-aminohippuric acid is equal to effective renal plasma flow.From the renal plasma flow, the renal blood flow can be calculated by dividing by 1 minus the haematocritRenal blood flow = RPF x1------------(1-Haematocrit)Renal blood flow = 1273ml/min which account for about 25% of cardiac output.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nMaximum water reabsorption occurs in-\n* Proximal convoluted tubule (Correct Answer)\n* Distal convoluted tubule\n* Cortical collecting duct\n* Medullary collecting duct\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Proximal convoluted tubule * Most of the solutes and water are maximally absorbed in proximal tubulei) 60-70% of Na+ is reabsorbed along with 60-70% of Clii) 60-70% of K+ is reabsorbediii) 60-70% of water is reabsorbediv) All the (100%) glucose and amino-acids are absorbedv) About 80-90% of bicarbonate is reabsorbedvi) 40-50% of urea is reabsorbed\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nAs a pa of space-research program , a physiologist was asked to investigate the effect of flight-induced stress on blood pressure. Accordingly, the blood pressure of the cosmonauts were to be measured twice: once before the take-off and once after the spacecraft entered the designated orbit around the eah. For a proper comparison, the preflight blood pressure should be recorded in which position?\n* The sitting position\n* The standing position (Correct Answer)\n* The lying down position\n* Any position, as long as the post-flight recording is made in the same position\n\nExplanation: In the space there is no gravity. In order to compare the blood pressure taken preflight and the one in the space, BP should be taken in a position where gravity is nullified. In lying position the gravitational force is nullified, so preflight BP measurement should be done in the lying down position. In supine position, legs are at the same level as the hea so that the gravitational forces that come into play in the upright position are diminished. When a person is lying on his back, the tricuspid valve is located at almost exactly 60% of the chest thickness in front of the back. This the zero pressure reference level.

Laminin is a high molecular weight ECM protein. Many CAMs pass through the cell membrane and are anchored to the cytoskeleton inside the cell. Some bind to like molecules on other cells (homophilic binding), whereas others bind to nonself molecules (heterophilic binding). Actin is connected to the sarcolemma, from where integrin connects it to laminin in ECM.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nNormal diffusion of CO2 at rest\n* 20-25 ml/min\n* 50-100 ml/min\n* 100-200 ml/min (Correct Answer)\n* 400-500 ml/min\n\nExplanation: Normal diffusion capacity of co2 is about 400 to 500 ml per minute Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number:350,351,352\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nRegarding carbon monoxide toxicity true are all, except -a) Cytochrome toxicity is lethalb) Treated by 5% CO2c) PO2 is decreasedd) Shift HbO2 dissociation curve to lefte) Gaseous vasodilator\n* ac (Correct Answer)\n* bc\n* ad\n* b\n\nExplanation: CO to be lethal to cytochrome, the dose needs to be 100 times than that of the lethal dose.\n \nSince Hb has more affinity to CO than oxygen, it results in anemic hypoxia. PO2 remain normal as it is the dissolved form. Hb-O2 dissociation curve shifts to left. Treatment for CO poisoning is by hyperbaric oxygen. But 95% O2 + 5% CO2 can also be used. CO is a gaseous vasodilator.\n\n## Question from Physiology:\nFollowing change is noted during exercise\n* Blood flow to brain increases with increase in mean systolic blood pressure (Correct Answer)\n* Body temperature increases\n* Lymphatic flow from muscle decreases\n* Blood flow to muscles increase after half a minute\n\nExplanation: During strenuous exercise, the body&;s heat production may exceed 1000 W. Some of the heat produced is stored, raising body core temperature by a few degrees. Rises in body temperature are sensed by central and skin thermoreceptors and this sensory information are processed by the hypothalamus to trigger appropriate effector responses. Other sensory inputs from baroreceptors and osmoreceptors can modify these responses.\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\nIf a person is asked, \"what will he do if he sees a house on fire\"?, Then what is being tested in that person ?\n* Social judgement (Correct Answer)\n* Test judgement\n* Response judgement\n* None of the above\n\nExplanation: AnS.

SSRIs have been shown to help reduce or prevent various forms of anxiety, including panic anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and social anxiety. Most treatment algorithms begin treatment of each of these disorders with an SSRI.Serotonin-Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine has been shown in randomized, controlled trials to be as effective as SSRIs in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and generalized social anxiety disorder.Beta blockers like propranalol and atenolol are particularly useful in management of anticipatory anxiety (anxiety occurring before going on stage, or before examinations)Buspirone is an anti anxiety drug which does not have any dependence potential, unlike benzodiazepines.Note on anxiety disordersAnxiety is the commonest psychiatric symptom in clinical practice and anxiety disorders are one of the commonest psychiatric disorders in general population.1) Generalised anxiety disorder: This is characterized by an insidious onset in the third decade and a stable, usually chronic course which may or may not be punctuated by panic attacks.The symptoms of anxiety should last tor at least a period of 6 months for a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder to be made. It is the commonest psychiatric disorder in the population.2) Panic disorder: This is characterized by discrete episodes of acute anxiety. Panic disorder can either present alone or with agoraphobia.Note on phobiasPhobia is defined as an irrational fear of a specific object. situation or activity, often leading to persistant avoidance of the feared object situation or activity, often leading to persistant avoidance of the feared object situation or activity.The common type of phobias are:a) Agoraphobia-It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice.lt is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from the familiar setting of home. It includes fear of open spaces.public spaces, crowded spaces and any other place from where there is no easy escape to a safe place.A full blown attack may occur (agoraphobia with panic disorder) or only a few symptoms(like dizziness or tachycardia) may occur (agoraphobia without panic disorder)SSRIs are currently the drugs of choice .with paroxetine being the most widely used drug. \"Nomophobia\"-one of the latest additions to the phobia list.

A psychological theory of mind and personality development based primarily on the concept of intrapsychic conflict.2. A procedure for the investigation of unconscious psychic processes otherwise inaccessible3. A therapeutic technique of treating psychiatric disorder by psychological means.NAMECOMMENTSEugen Bleuler- Named schizophrenia, and held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process.- First introduced the term autism in 1911.- Coined the term ambivalence (the coexistence of two opposing drives, desires, feelings or emotions towards the same person, object or goal) to designate one of the major symptoms of schizophrenia.Kraeplin- Coined the term 'dementia precox'.Sigmond Freud- 'Psychotherapy' is after his name.- Invention of 'psychoanalysis'\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\nAll of the following are done in behavior therapy to increase a behavior except:\n* Punishment (Correct Answer)\n* Operant conditioning\n* Negative reinforcement\n* Reward\n\nExplanation: A i.e. Punishment Punishment & frustrative-non reward lead to decrease in resultant behavior, whereas both positive & negative reinforcements increases (reinforces) the frequency of a paicular response. Operant conditioning describes how consequences of a behavior lead to an increase or decrease in that behavior. Behavior is increased when it is followed by reward (Positive reinforcement) or removal of unpleasant stimulus (negative reinforcement) and reduced by taking away a positive stimulus (frustrative-non reward) or adding a negative stimulus (punishment).\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\nAll the following drugs are hallucinogens except\n* Mescaline\n* Phencyclidine\n* Ketamine (Correct Answer)\n* Pentostatin\n\nExplanation: Pentostatin is an anticancer drug Hallucinogens-LSD,Phencyclidine,ketamine,mescaline etc Ref: Essentials of postgraduate psychiatry By JN Vyas 1st ed Pg. 326\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\n\"Foli a deux\" is\n* Delusion of doubles\n* Substance abuse disorder (Correct Answer)\n* Sharing delusion with one more person\n* Dissociation disorder\n\nExplanation: The person with delusion influences the other to develop same delusion.\n2 persons sharing same delusion  - \"Foli a deux\".\n3 persons sharing same delusion  - \"Foli a trios\".\nSharing a delusion to group of people : Pseudo community.\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\n25 yr old gentleman has repeated thoughts that he has not locked his car door properly, frequently checks it while driving, he repeatedly checks locks in his house. Diagnosis\n* OCD (Correct Answer)\n* OPCD\n* Phobia\n* Personality disorder\n\nExplanation: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder : Obsession: recurrent and persistent thoughts that are involuntary unwanted, distressing and the individual tries to neutralize them by a thought or action (compulsion). Ex: Contamination(most common), Need for symmetry, Pathological doubt, Sexual compulsion: Act aimed to reduce the anxiety arising out of obsession but fails to do so. Ex: checking(most common), washing, counting, Hoarding, counting. obsession (a door is unlocked )leads to compulsion (checking ), which tries to relieve distress but fails and the obsession-compulsion cycle repeats leading to distress, time consumption. thoughts are one's own thoughts, it may be an idea/urge/image -behavior or mental behavior. M:F- 1:1 age of onset 20-25 years 2-3% prevalence in general population Comorbidity: major depressive disorder, delusional beliefs, overvalued ideas, personality disorder Etiology Psychoanalytical concept*-regression from the oedipal phase to the anal psychosexual phase.

Acamprosate (the Ca++ salt of N-acetyl-homo taurinate) interacts with NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission in the various brain regions and reduces Ca++ fluxes through voltage-operatedchannels. Naltrexone (oral opioid receptor antagonist) probably interferes with alcohol-induced reinforcement by blocking opioid receptors. Fluoxetine (and other SSRIs) have been occasionally used as anti-craving agents in their usual antidepressant doses.

The exposure is hierarchical from less anxiety provoking to higher anxiety producing stimuli.\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\nMale started alcohol at 20 years, presently taking 3 quarters daily over 30 years, now complains that he gets the kick in 1 quarter, diagnosis is:\n* Withdrawal\n* Mellanby phenomenon (Correct Answer)\n* Reverse tolerance\n* Cross tolerance\n\nExplanation: Ans. c. Reverse tolerance (Ref: Kaplan and Sadock's 9/e p1271; Mellanby effect)People with a lot of alcoholic liver damage can no longer metabolize alcohol very well, these people can get very intoxicated on small quantities of alcohol -much smaller quantities than are needed to affect the person who rarely drinks. This phenomenon is known as Reverse Tolerance.Reverse ToleranceReverse Tolerance occurs when a heavy drinker develops liver damage and the liver no longer produces as great a quantity of the enzymes needed to break down alcohol in the body as it did before.Since people with a lot of alcoholic liver damage can no longer metabolize alcohol very well, these people can get very intoxicated on small quantities of alcohol -much smaller quantities than are needed to affect the person who rarely drinks. This phenomenon is known as Reverse ToleranceQ.It is important to note that most heavy drinkers do NOT develop liver damage or Reverse Tolerance.The majority of heavy drinkers will not suffer liver damage and hence will not develop Reverse Tolerance.The way that Reverse Tolerance can develop over a lifetime is illustrated by the curve in Figure.Healthy Tolerance Reversal which occurs when a heavy drinker does a period of abstinence from alcohol or a period of moderate drinking.The essential difference between Reverse Tolerance and Healthy Tolerance Reversal is that Reverse Tolerance is caused by damage to the liver which is often irreversible.In Healthy Tolerance Reversal the liver is actually becoming more healthy than it was during the period of heavy drinking and the reason why the tolerance is dropping is that the excessive and unhealthy levels of liver enzymes associated with heavy drinking are now returning to normal and healthy levels.Mellanby Effect( style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\"> Mellanby effect)*The most widely used acute tolerance measure in human research is often called the Mellanby effect* Involves the comparison of responses at the same blood alcohol concentrations on the ascending and descending limbsa of the blood alcohol curve\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\nAll are true about bulimia nervosa except:\n* Amenorrhoea (Correct Answer)\n* Binge eating\n* Purgation and vomiting\n* Normal body contour\n\nExplanation: Ans: a (Amenorrhoea) Ref: Ahuja, 6th ed, p.

It occurs much more often in females as compared to the males. The common age of onset is adolescence (13-19 years of age). 2. There is an intense fear of becoming obese. This fear does not decrease even if the body becomes very thin and underweight. 3. There is often a body-image disturbance. The person is unable to perceive own body size accurately. 4. There is a refusal to maintain the body weight above a minimally normal weight for that age, sex and height. 5. Significant weight loss occurs, usually more than 25% of the original weight. The final weight is usually 15% less than the minimum limit of normal weight (for that age, sex and height) or a Quetelet's body-mass index (BMI) of 17.5 or less 6. No known medical illness, which can account for the weight loss, is present. 7. An absence of any other primary psychiatric disorder. 8. Amenorrhoea, primary or secondary, is often present in females. Bulimia Nervosa Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterised by the following clinical features: 1. Bulimia nervosa usually has an onset in early teens or adolescence. 2. There is an intense fear of becoming obese. There may be an earlier history of anorexia nervosa. 3. There is usually body-image disturbance and the person is unable to perceive own body size accurately. 4. There is a persistent preoccupation with eating and an irresistible craving for food. There are episodes of overeating in which large amounts of food are consumed within sho periods of time (eating binges). 5. There are attempts to 'counteract' the effects of overeating by one or more of the following: self-induced vomiting, purgative abuse, periods of starvation, and/or use of drugs such as appetite suppressants. 6. No known medical illness is present which can account for the disorder. 7. An absence of any other primary psychiatric disorder.

Depressive episode : - Single episode of depression. Bipolar mood (affective) disorders : - Recurrent episodes of mania alone or recurrent episodes of mania & depression in the same patient at different times. Recurrent depressive disorder : - Recurrent (two or more) depressive episodes. Persistent mood disorder : - Persistent mood symptoms which last for more than 2 years (I year in children & adolescents). Example are dysthemia & cyclothymia. Other mood disorders : - Mixed episodes, i.e., picture of depression and mania is present at the same time intermixed (in contrast to bipolar disorders where depression and mania occur at different time). It also includes rapid cycling --> picture of mania and depression alternates rapidly with each other without a normal intervening period (in contrast to bipolar disorder where normal intervening is present between two episodes).\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\nAll are true of Delerium tremens EXCEPT:\n* Severe depression (Correct Answer)\n* Hallucination\n* Extreme anxiety\n* Delusion\n\nExplanation: Severe depression REF: Kaplan and sadock's synopsis of psychiatry 10th ed page 398-399DELIRIUM TREMENS:Most common type of alcohol withdrawalWithin 2-4 days of abstinence from severe drinkingNew memory retention and registration impairedCloudy consciousness, DisorientationVisual hallucination more than tactile and auditoryDisturbed sleep wake cycleSun downing or diurnal variationPsychomotor and autonomic agitationDOC- chlordiazepoxide\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\nWhich type of Schizophrenia carries the best prognosis\n* Simple (Correct Answer)\n* Catatonic\n* Hebephrenic\n* Paranoid\n\nExplanation: Catatonic schizophrenia carries the best prognosis.\nIt is charaxterized by Akinetic mutism & stupor.\nECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is the treatment of choice.\n\n## Question from Psychiatry:\nA young lady is present with history of repeated episodes of overeating followed by purging using laxatives, she is probably suffering from\n* Bulimia nervosa (Correct Answer)\n* Schizophrenia\n* Anorexia nervosa\n* Benign eating disorders\n\nExplanation: Bulimia Nervosa Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder charac terised by the following clinical features: 1.

Patient gives h/o RTA 1 week back. A panoramic X-ray was taken using fast intensifying screen. Which of the following is not true about the screen used in this patient?\n* They have large phosphor crystals\n* They produce images with lower resolution\n* They have a thicker phosphor layer and a reflective layer (Correct Answer)\n* They increase image sharpness\n\nExplanation: Fast screens have large phosphor crystals and efficiently convert X-ray photons to visible light, but produce images with lower resolution. Fast screens also have a thicker phosphor layer and a reflective layer, but these properties also decrease sharpness. In deciding on the combination to use, the practitioner must consider the resolution requirements of the task for which the image will be used. Screen-film combinations are rated for speed, a measure of the amount of radiation required for proper exposure. For dental extraoral diagnostic tasks, it is recommended to use screen-film combinations that have a speed of 400 or faster.\nWhite and Pharoah, Oral radiology, ed 7th, pg-67\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nA 25 year old young male with abdominal pain after sustaining blunt trauma to his abdomen during a road traffic accident has brought to emergency depament.

Bushberg 2/e p3.56 writes? \"What do CT numbers correspond to physically in the patient? CT images are produced with a highly filtered, high-kV x-ray beam, with an average energy of about 75 keV. At this energy in muscle tissue, about 91% of x-ray interactions are Comptom scatter. For .fat and hone, Compton scattering interactions are 94% and 74%, respectively. Therefore, CT numbers and CT images derive their contrast mainly .from the physical propeies of tissue that influence Compton scatter. Density (g/cubic cm) is a very impoant discriminating propey of tissue, and the linear attenuation coefficient (p) tracks linearly with density. Other than physical density, the Compton scatter cross section depends on the electron density in tissue: Electron density = NZ/A where N is Avogadro's number (a constant) Z is the atomic number, A is the atomic mass The main constituents of soft tissue are hydrogen (Z = 1, A = 1), carbon (Z = 6, A = 12), nitrogen (Z = 7, A = 14), and oxygen (Z = 8, A = 16). Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen all have the WA ratio of 0.5, so their electron densities are the same. Because the Z/A ratio .for hydrogen is 1.0, the relative abundance of hydrogen in a tissue has some influence on CT number. Hydrogenous tissue such as fat is well visualized on CT Neveheless, density (g/cubic cm) plays the dominant role in forming contrast in medical CT.\" \"The difference in electron density of tissues depends upon physical density. Therefore, the soft tissue contrast achieved in an image is primarily determined by the relative physical densities of the structures, not by the relative differences in atomic numbers.\"- Neuroimaging By Robe A. Zimmerman, Wendell A. Gibby, Raymond F. Carmody P5 CT is a tomographic imaging technique that generates cross-sectional images in the axial plane. The basic concept of x-ray CT is simple. By looking at an object from multiple directions a three dimensional representation of that object can be formed. A thin beam of x-rays is passed through the body from multiple different projections. When an x-ray beam passes through the body, there is a logarithmic attenuation of its intensity over distance. A measurement of the intensity of the exiting beam is known as the linear attenuation coefficient when the attenuator thickness is 1 cm. The linear attenuation coefficient is related to the absorption of a given material both photoelectric interaction and Comptom scattering interactions. This, of course, depends upon the energy of the x-ray beam and the type of material being irradiated. CT images are maps of the relative linear attenuation coefficient of tissues. The relative attenuation coefficient is normally expressed in Hounsfield units (HU), also known as CT numbers (Named in honor of the inventor of CT, Geoffrey Hounsfield). The HU of material Xis HU = 1000 X (14-14)/1.1.,,., where x, is the attenuation coefficient of the material X, and ix,. is the attenuation coefficient of water. By definition, the HU value for water is always zero. HU value for air is -1000 ( minus 1000) HU value for coical bone is 1000\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nSymptomatic spinal injury without any radiological evidence most commonly found in:\n* Children (Correct Answer)\n* Elderly\n* Teenagers\n* Young adults\n\nExplanation: Ans. a. Children (Ref: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17006044 www.orthopaedicsone.com/pages/viewpage action? pageId=27689773)Symptomatic spinal injury without any radiological evidence most commonly found in children.'Following trauma, the commonly used radiological investigations, plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) studies do nor rule out injury to the spinal cord. This is especially true for children, as an entity known by the acronym SCIWORA (spinal cord injury without radiological abnormality) exists and the changes may be picked up only on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Early treatment (within 6 hours) with high dose methylprednisolone improves the outcome.'- www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17006044SCIWORA (Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiologic Abnormality)SCIWORA originally referred to spinal cord injury without radiographic or CT evidence of fracture or dislocationQPrognosis of SCIWORA is actually better than patients with spinal cord injury and radiologic evidence of traumatic injuryQ.Defined as 'objective signs of myelopathy as a result of trauma' with no evidence of fracture or ligamentous instability on plain spine radiographs and tomographyQPrevalence:Mostly in pediatric population (range: birth to 16 years old)Inherent elasticity in pediatric cervical spine can allow severe spinal cord injury to occur in absence of X-ray findingsQCommon in cervical and thoracic regionQ; Rare in lumbar regionMechanism of Injury:MVA (motor vehicle accident)FallSports injury: Football, Diving, Wrestling, GymnasticsPathogenesis:Hyperextension injury to spine whose vertebral canal diameter is already compromised by spondylosisQ has a high risk of cord injuryExcessive anterior buckling of ligamentum flavum into canalQ, already compromised by posterior vertebral body osteophytes, probably is the cause of central cord syndromePathophysiologic MechanismsDirect spinal cord injury (traction)Direct spinal cord compression (extreme flexion/ hyperextension)Indirect spinal cord injuryVascular/ischemic injuryDiagnosis:SCIWORA is mainly a diagnosis of exclusion.In children, after trauma, paucity of movement of both legs, inability to bear weight on legs, and inability to pass urine, not able to sit without supportQ.Examination:Gross hypotonia in the lower limbs. 0/5 power and areflexia.Abdominal reflex, cremasteric, and anal reflex are absent.Palpable bladder and urine could be expressed out on abdominal pressure.No meningeal or cerebellar signsWork up:Plain radiographs of the entire spinal column maybe consideredCT scan of suspected level of neurological injuryMRI of the suspected region of neurological injury may show- hemorrhage and edemaQSSEPs (somatosensory evoked potentials):Not used diagnosticallyHelpful for follow up; obtained within 24 hours of admission and compared in follow up analysisTreatmentExternal immobilization of the spinal segment of injury for up to 12 weeksAvoidance of 'high-risk' activities for up to 6 monthsGradually increase range of motion once deficits have resolvedHigh-dose steroids in SCIWORAMethylprednisolone bolus of 30 mg/kg IV within 8 hours of injury, followed by infusion at 5.4 mg/kg/hr for the next 23 hours beneficial in improving the outcomeQOutcome at 6 weeks and 6 months better when drug given over 48 hoursQ, according to recent study.Prognosis:MRl of region of neurologic injury may provide useful prognostic information about neurologic outcome following SCIWORAQ.Poor Prognosis is seen inChildren <8 years old have worse prognosisDelay in onset of neurologic symptomsDeterioration of neurologic symptomsRecurrent injury\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nA 32-years-old young businessman student was found to have with a solitary 2 cm space-occupying lesion of mixed echogenicity in the right lobe of liver on ultrasound examination. The rest of the liver was normal except for mild increase in overall echogenicity. Which of the following test should be done next?\n* Ultrasound guided biopsy\n* Hepatic scintigraphy\n* MRI (Correct Answer)\n* Triple phase CECT\n\nExplanation: Modern computed tomography (CT) technology Increased the accuracy of diagnosis and staging of liver lesionsand contrast-enhanced computed tomography is currently the most widely used and best validated modality for liver imaging. Oral contrast enhancement allows visualization of the stomach and duodenum in relation to the liver hilum. The early aerial phase of the intravenous contrast vascular enhancement is paicularly useful for detecting small primary liver cancers, owing to their preferential aerial blood supply. The venous phase maps the branches of the poal vein within the liver and the drainage the hepatic veins. Inflammatory liver lesions often exhibit rim enhancement with intravenous contrast, whereas the common haemangioma characteristically shows late venous enhancement. The density of any liver lesion can be measured, which can be useful in establishing the presence of a cystic lesion. CT has high accuracy in determining the stage, and high sensitivity and specificity in determining resectability of liver tumours. Local and distant metastases can also be detected, although peritoneal metastases are often missed on CT. =Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would appear to be as effective an imaging modality as CT in the majority of patients with liver disease. It does, however, offer several advantages. First, the use of iodine-containing intra- venous contrast agents is precluded in many patients because of a history of allergy. These patients should be offered MRI rather than contrast CT. Second, MRI with contrast may be useful for detecting and defining lesions of liver like complex hemangiomas. =Radioisotope scanning can provide impoant diagnostic information. HIDA is a technetium-99m (99mTc)-labelled radio- nuclide that is administered intravenously, removed from the circulation by the liver, processed by hepatocytes and excreted in the bile. Imaging under a gamma camera allows its uptake and excretion to be monitored in real time. This is a useful non- invasive test when there is suspicion of bile leak.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nColon cut off sign seen in –\n* Acute pancreatitis (Correct Answer)\n* Diverculities\n* Appendicitis\n* Carcinoma colon\n\nExplanation: Colon cut off sign is seen in acute pancreatitis.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nGamma camera is used for: September 2007\n* Measuring the radioactivity\n* Radionuclide scans (Correct Answer)\n* Both of the above\n* None of the above\n\nExplanation: Ans. C: Both of the above A gamma camera/scintillation camera/ Anger camera is a device used to image gamma radiation emitting radioisotopes, a technique known as scintigraphy. The applications of scintigraphy include early drug development and nuclear medical imaging to view and analyse images of the human body or the distribution of medically injected, inhaled, or ingested radionuclides emitting gamma rays. Scintigraphy is the use of gamma cameras to capture emitted radiation from internal radioisotopes to create twodimensional images. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging, as used in nuclear cardiac stress testing, is performed using gamma cameras, usually one, two or three detectors or heads, are slowly rotated around the patient's torso. Multiheaded gamma cameras can also be used for Positron emission tomography scanning. Gamma camera PET is markedly inferior to PET imaging with a purpose designed PET scanner, as the scintillator crystal has poor sensitivity for the high-energy annihilation photons, and the detector area is significantly smaller. However, given the low cost of a gamma camera and its additional flexibility compared to a dedicated PET scanner, this technique is useful where the expense and resource implications of a PET scanner cannot be justified.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nSpider leg appearance is found in –\n* Polycystic kidney (Correct Answer)\n* Pyelonephritis\n* Hydronephrosis\n* Renal artery stenosis\n\nExplanation: Spider leg appearance on IVP is seen in Polycystic kidney disease.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nIn Radionuclide imaging the most useful radiopharmaceutical for skeletal imaging is –\n* Gallium 67 (67Ga)\n* Technetium–sulphur-colloid (99mTc–Sc)\n* Technetium–99m (99mTc) (Correct Answer)\n* Technetium–99m linked to Methylene disphosphonate (99mTc–MDP)\n\nExplanation: Tc 99 is the most common radiopharmaceutical used for imaging in nuclear medicine. For skeletal imaging Diphosphonate Ligands are used as these agents are deposited on sites of actively growing bone. The diphosphonate ligand has a high affinity for actively growing bone. 99Tc-MDP is the most widely used of the diphosphonate ligands- Bone Scintigraphy.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nTrue regarding FLAIR MRI\n* CSF appears bright on T2-FLAIR (Correct Answer)\n* It negates the fluid signals.\n* FLAIR stands for Fluid Attenuation Induction and Recovery.\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: T2-FLAIR stands for T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is a pulse sequence used in magnetic resonance imaging which was invented by Dr. Graeme Bydder. FLAIR can be used with both three-dimensional imaging (3D FLAIR) and two dimensional imaging (2D FLAIR). The pulse sequence is an inversion recovery technique that nulls fluids. Structures with more water such as CSF or edema have long T1 and T2 relaxation times, resulting in higher signal intensity on T2-weighted images. T2 images are also more sensitive for detecting demyelination, infarction, and chronic hemorrhage. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is a type of T2- weighted image that suppresses the high-intensity signal of CSF. As a result, images created by the FLAIR technique are more sensitive to detecting water- containing things/lesions.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nA labourer presented with chronic cough. X-ray shows \"egg shell\" calcification in hilar nodes which are diagnostic of:\n* Asbestosis (Correct Answer)\n* Silicosis\n* Berylliosis\n* Baritosis\n\nExplanation: Very early silicosis may be seen only on CT, although in the later stages of the process, the small nodules and conglomerate masses are readily seen on either conventional radiographs or CT images. Hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes may calcify in the periphery of the lymph node, a type of calcification known as eggshell calcification. An acute form of silicosis radiographically resembles pulmonary edema. Ref: Chiles C., Gulla S.M. (2011). Chapter 4. Radiology of the Chest. In M.Y. Chen, T.L. Pope, D.J. Ott (Eds), Basic Radiology, 2e.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nUse of filters result in:\n* Softer beam radiation\n* Wider beam coverage\n* Less penetrating beam (Correct Answer)\n* Beam of greater intensity\n\nExplanation: Ans. Beam of greater intensity\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nA 24-year-old female graduate student repos increasing shoness of breath with exercise and has recently noticed dyspnea on mild activity. One day before presenting at the office, she experienced sudden loss of consciousness while shopping at a grocery store. On physical examination, vital signs are: pulse 88 bpm; temperature 97.8degF; respirations 18/min; blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. BMI is 34. ABGs on RA: pH 7.43; PCO2 36 mm Hg; PO2 87 mm Hg. Chest x-rays are shown in.The clinical and chest radiographic diagnosis may be commonly associated with\n* A loud A2 on cardiac auscultation (Correct Answer)\n* Right arm swelling\n* Rib notching\n* A loud P2 on cardiac auscultation\n\nExplanation: The lateral view shows that the anterior clear space behind the sternum is occupied above a poion of the lower one-third of the cardiac shadow. The truncus of the right pulmonary aery seen in front of the trachea is very large and the left main pulmonary aery coursing over the left upper lobe bronchus is greater than 16 mm. These findings are consistent with pulmonary aerial hypeension. The chest x-ray shows large pulmonary aeries, and this, coupled with the clinical scenario, is consistent with primary pulmonary hypeension (PPH). As mentioned in the general discussion, this entity is due to an unknown cause. The physical sign most likely to be present would be a loud P2, and right hea catheterization would confirm the high pulmonary aery (PA) pressures. Patients with PPH may give a history of syncopal episodes. A loud A2 is heard in systemic hypeension, and rib notching is classically seen on the x-ray in coarctation of the aoa. Right arm swelling is seen with either a localized vascular or lymphatic obstruction such as postradiation, malignancy, or superior vena cava syndrome. This patient does not exhibit any of these signs. Since the hilar shadows are of vascular nature, mediastinoscopy or bronchoscopy would not be indicated and in fact may be dangerous if PA pressures are very high.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nContrast material used in the diagnosis of esophageal atresia is\n* Gastrograffin\n* Conray 420 (Correct Answer)\n* Dianosil\n* Myodii\n\nExplanation: C i.e. Dianosil\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nThumb print sign in plain x-ray is seen in:\n* Ischeamic colitis (Correct Answer)\n* Ulcerative colitis\n* Pseudomembranous colitis\n* Appendicitis\n\nExplanation: Ans: a (Ischeamic colitis)Ref: Harrison, 17 ed. pg. 1091, 213; Grainger and Allison 5 ed. pg. 889.Thumb printing sign, i.e., bowel wall oedema seen as an early sign in ischaemic colitis.

They are made of parallel strips of lead with an inter-space having aluminum or organic spacer and prevents scatter radiation from forming the image while allowing the straight beam to pass.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nThe Renal function is best assessed by:\n* Tc 99m DMSA\n* Tc 99m DTPA (Correct Answer)\n* Tc 99m MAG3\n* Tc 99m pertechnetate\n\nExplanation: Ans. C. Tc 99m MAG3* The Renal function is best assessed by Tc-99m MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine). It is eliminated through kidney as via both glomeruli filtration and tubular excretion.* Tc-99m DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) is used to evaluate renal structure and morphology, particularly in pediatric imaging for detection of scarring and pyelonephritis.* DMSA is an ideal agent for the assessment of renal cortex as it binds to the sulfhydryl groups in proximal tubules at the renal cortex with longer retention than other agents. Also, it allows better assessment of differential renal function* Tc-99m DTPA (diethylene-triamine-Penta acetate) is cleared only via glomeruli with no tubular excretion. Hence used for direct measurement of GFR.* The screening investigation used in reno-vascular hypertension is Captopril DTPA and the gold standard investigation is renal angiography.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nTriangular cord sign in a neonate is seen in?\n* Galactosema\n* Hepatitis (Correct Answer)\n* Biliary atresia\n* Hemangioblastoma\n\nExplanation: Ans CThe triangular cord signQ is a triangular or tubular echogenic cord of fibrous tissue seen in the porta hepatis at ultrasonography and is relatively specific for the diagnosis of biliary atresiaQ. It is useful in the evaluation of infants with cholestatic jaundice, helps in differentiating from neonatal hepatitis.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nInvestigation of choice for gall stone –\n* X–ray (Correct Answer)\n* USG\n* Cholecystography\n* CAT Scan\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nWhich of the following reduces the development of unexposed Ag halide crystals, and also acts as antifog agent?\n* Phenidone\n* Potassium hydroxide\n* Sodium sulfite (Correct Answer)\n* Sodium bromide\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nInvestigation of choice for bronchiectasis is: September 2009\n* Chest X-ray\n* MRI (Correct Answer)\n* CT scan\n* V-P scan\n\nExplanation: Ans. C: CT Scan High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis. It shows dilated bronchi adjacent to vascular structure forming a signet ring shape. The diameter of the lumen of the bronchi is characteristically larger than that of the vascular structure. The dilatation of proximal airways alone may indicate the possibility of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Dilated bronchi with multiple small parenchymal nodules point towards possible infection with Mycobacterium avium complex.\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nCobble stoning of intestine with string sign of kantor is seen in:\n* Crohn's disease (Correct Answer)\n* Ulcerative coitis\n* Ishemic colitis\n* Amoebic colitic\n\nExplanation: Ans.

D All of the above Radium was discovered in 1898 by French physicist and Nobel laureate Marie Curie in pitchblende (a uranium andradiumbearing mineral). There is about 1 gram of radium in 7 tons of pitchblende.Elemental radium was isolated by Madam Merry Curie in 1911 Radium is a naturally radioactive, silvery-white metal when freshly cut. It blackens on exposure to air. Purified radium and some radium compounds glow in the dark (luminesce). The radiation emitted by radium can also cause ceain materials, called \"phosphors\" to emit light. Mixtures of radium salts and appropriate phosphors were widely used for clock dials and gauges before the risks of radium exposure were understood. Metallic radium is highly chemically reactive. It forms compounds that are very similar to barium compounds, making separation of the two elements difficult. The various isotopes of radium originate from the radioactive decay of uranium or thorium. Radium-226, the most common isotope, is an alpha emitter, with accompanying gamma radiation, and has a half-life of about 1600 years. Radium-228, is principally a beta emitter and has a half-life of 5.76 years. Radium-224, an alpha emitter, has a half life of 3.66 days. Radium decays to form isotopes of the radioactive gas radon, which is not chemically reactive.

The patient’s head is tilted downward so that the canthomeatal line forms a 25-degree to 30 degree angle with the image receptor. To improve the visualization of the condyles, the patient’s mouth is opened, so that the condylar  heads are located inferior to the articular eminence. When requesting this image to evaluate the condyles, it is necessary to specify “open-mouth, Reverse-Towne”; otherwise, a standard Towne view of the occiput may result.\nPosition of Central X-Ray Beam\nThe central beam is perpendicular to the image receptor and parallel to the patient’s midsagittal plane and is centered at the level of the condyles.\nResultant Image \nThe midsagittal plane (represented by an imaginary line extending from the middle of the foramen magnum and the posterior arch of the atlas through the middle of the bridge of the nose and the nasal septum) should divide the skull image in two symmetric halves. The petrous ridge of the temporal bone should be super-imposed at the inferior part of the occipital bone, and the condylar heads should be projected inferior to the articular eminence.\nWhite and Pharoah, Oral radiology, ed 7th, pg- 163\n\n## Question from Radiology:\nA PLHA patient came to neurology OPD with complaints of headache and blurring of vision since 15 days.

These may be found on the skin, oral mucosa, nasal mucosa and conjunctiva.\" Ref: Robbins\"Most common presenting feature is Epistaxis (90% cases)\"\"Cerebral Arteriovenous malformations in 10% cases.\"\"In severe cases of HHT. recurrent epistaxis refractory to ablative treatment is treated surgically with nasal septum skin transplants by using skin taken from the tower trunk. Severe cases of HHT may respond to estrogen therapy.\"* Though estrogen is indicated in severe cases of HHT, it is not the first line treatment.Hereditary Hemorharqic Telangiectasia I Osler-Weber-Rendu Disease (OWRD)Autosomal dominant disorder.Generalized vascular dysplasia affecting blood vessels throughout the body.Increased tendency for bleeding.Four major clinical diagnostic criteria (Curagao criteria) are:o Epistaxis.o Telangiectasias.o Visceral lesions.o Family history (a first-degree relative with HHT).The HHT diagnosis is classified as definite if 3 or 4 criteria are present, possible or suspected if 2 criteria are present, and unlikely if fewer than 2 criteria are present.HHT has been classified into the following 4 types:o HHT type 1o HHT type 2o HHT type 3o HHT-juvenile polyposis overlap syndrome (JPHT).HHT is attributed to genetic mutations that involve signaling of TGF-p.Defects in at least 4 genes are implicated in its development:o Mutations of ENG (encoding endoglin) - These characterize HHT type 1 and involve chromosome 9.o Mutations of ALK1 (encoding ALK-1), also called ACVRL1 (activin A receptor kinase type II-like 1) - These are implicated in HHT type 2 and involve chromosome 12.o Mutations of chromosome 5 (5q31.1 -32) - These are distinct from hereditary benign telangiectasia (HBT), a gene defect in RASA1 (chromosome 5q14).o Mutations of SMAD4/MADH4 (encoding Smad4) - These are described in JPHT, which is also autosomal dominant, involves chromosome 18, and combines clinical manifestations of HHT and juvenile polyposis.The first 2 (HHT types 1 and 2) account for approximately 85% of cases.Clinical FeaturesClassic triad of Osler-Weber-Rendu diseaseo Telangiectases of the skin and mucous membranes,o Epistaxis.o Positive family history.Visceral and central nervous system (CNS) involvement.Cerebral AVMs in 10% cases.Most common presenting complaint - Epistaxis (90% cases).Second Most common presenting complaint - Skin telangiectases - 75% cases.Hepatic or pulmonary involvement - Arteriovenous malformations seen in 30% cases.Gastrointestinal Symptomso Gastrointestinal (Gl) bleeding in 15% cases. The risk of Gl tract bleeding increases at approximately 50 years of age.o Recurrent painless Gl bleeding occurs in 10-40% of patients,o Visceral AVMs.o Abdominal pain due to thrombosis of Gl AVMs.Hepatic Symptomso Liver involvement (often asymptomatic) is reported in as many as 40% of patients.o Symptoms may include right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, symptoms of high-output cardiac failure, and bleeding from esophageal varices.o Cardiac failure is caused by a large teft-to-right shunt due to AV fistula.o Atypical cirrhosis.Neurologic Symptomso Migraine headaches,o Stroke and brain abscess,o Spinal AVMs in children.o Acute paraplegia due to spinal arteriovenous fistula.Misc Symptomso Iron deficiency anemia caused by recurrent blood loss, o Intraocular hemorrhage.o Bloody tears due to conjunctival telangiectases.Complicationso Brain abscess,o Hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, o High-output congestive heart failure,o Chronic Gl bleeding and anemiao Portal hypertension with esophageal varices,o Pulmonary hemorrhage,o Liver cirrhosis.Curasao Criteria for diagnosis of HHT:o Epistaxis - Spontaneous and recurrent.o Telangiectases - Multiple characteristic sites (eg, lips, oral cavity, fingers or nose).o Visceral lesions - Gastrointestinal (GI) telangiectasia (with or without bleeding), pulmonary arteriovenous malfermation (AVM), hepatic AVM, cerebral AVM and spinal AVM.o Family history - A first-degree relative who has HHT (according to these same criteria).o HHT diagnosis is classified as definite if 3 criteria are present, possible or suspected if 2 criteria are present, and unlikely if fewer than 2 criteria are present.\n\n## Question from Skin:\nBerkeley membrane is seen in\n* Psoriasis (Correct Answer)\n* Pemphigus\n* Tinea capitis\n* Pityriasis rubra\n\nExplanation: Psoriasis\n\n## Question from Skin:\nWhich of these statements is false for Erytherma marginatum :\n* Lesions are serpiginous\n* Characteristically it is an evanescent\n* Rash worsens on application of hea (Correct Answer)\n* Rash is itchy\n\nExplanation: D i.e. Rash is itchy These rashes in Erythema marginatum are transient, migrating from place to place, non-pruritic, not indurated and blanch on pressure.

There are four principal subtypes, and all are due to mutations in anchoring fibril type VII collagen. Anchoring fibrils are therefore only rudimentary or absent. Of the four main types of DEB, dominant DEB or Cockayne-Touraine disease and recessive DEB (RDEB) are impoant. There is as yet no causal therapy for EB, but gene therapy is being investigated.

Characterized by round/oval pink brown patches with a superficial, centrifugal scale, distributed over trunk in a Christmas tree pattern. The disease is thought to be viral disease, is self limiting, and subsides in 6-12 weeks. The exact etiology is not known, but it is considered to be a viral disease; Human Herpes virus 6 (HHV 6) and Human Herpes virus 7 (HHV 7) may play a role.Clinical manifestations of P. roseao The disease starts with an upper respiratory prodrome or a mild flu. After 1-2 weeks, Annular erythmatous plaque appears on trunk that is referred to as mother patch or herald patch. Over the next 1 -2 weeks, fresh patch appear all over the trunk, in a Christmas tree configuration or Fir tree Configration. The lesions are pinkish in white skin, hence the name rosea. However, on the dark Indian skin the lesions are skin coloured or brown. The most characteristic clue for the diagnosis is the presence of a fine scale at the edge of the lesion referrred to as centrifugal scale or collarette scales or cigarette paper scales. Lesions subside with hyperpigmentation. Trunk is involved predominantly, Sometimes (in 20% of patients) lesions occur predominantly on extremities and neck (inverse pattern).o Hanging curtain sign is seen in patients with pityriasis rosea. When the skin is stretched across long axis of herald patch, the scale is noted to be finer, lighter, and attached to one end, which tends to fold across the line of scratch.Drug induced pityriasis roseao Some drugs may cause pityriasis rosea like skin lesions. Drugs causing pityriasis rosea like drug eruptions are : -# ACE inhibitors# Gold# Methotrexate# Metronidazole# Isotretinoin# b-blockers# Bismuth# Barbiturates# D- Penicillamine\n\n## Question from Skin:\nDennie Morgan folds are seen in\n* Lichen planus (Correct Answer)\n* Atopic dermatitis\n* Keratosis pilaris\n* Nummular eczema\n\nExplanation: Ans. b (Atopic dermatitis) (Ref. H - 18th/pg. 52, 52)Half of patients with Atopic dermatitis (AD) present within the first year of life, and 80% present by 5 years of age. About 80% ultimately coexpress allergic rhinitis or asthma. The infantile pattern is characterized by weeping inflammatory patches and crusted plaques on the face, neck, and extensor surfaces. The childhood and adolescent pattern is marked by dermatitis of flexural skin, particularly in the antecubital and popliteal fossae. AD may resolve spontaneously, but approximately 40% of all individuals affected as children will have dermatitis in adult life. The distribution of lesions may be similar to those seen in childhood; however, adults frequently have localized disease, manifesting as lichen simplex chronicus or hand eczema (see below). In patients with localized disease, AD may be suspected because of a typical personal history, family history, or the presence of cutaneous stigmata of AD such as perioral pallor, an extra fold of skin beneath the lower eyelid (Dennie-Morgan folds), increased palmar skin markings, and an increased incidence of cutaneous infections, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus. Regardless of other manifestations, pruritus is a prominent characteristic of AD in all age groups and is exacerbated by dry skin. Many of the cutaneous findings in affected patients, such as lichenification, are secondary to rubbing and scratching.SKIN FEATURES OF ATOPIC DERMATITIS# Atopic Pleat (Dennie-Morgan fold): An extra fold of skin that develops under the eye.# Cheilitis: Inflammation of the skin on and around the lips.# Hyperlinear Palms: Increased number of skin creases on the palms.# Hyperpigmented Eyelids: Eyelids that have become darker in color from inflammation or hay fever.# Ichthyosis: Dry, rectangular scales on the skin.# Keratosis Pilaris: Small, rough bumps, generally on the face, upper arms, and thighs.# Lichenification: Thick, leathery skin resulting from constant scratching and rubbing.# Papules: Small raised bumps that may open when scratched and become crusty and infected.# Urticaria: Hives (red, raised bumps) that may occur after exposure to an allergen, at the beginning of flares, or after exercise or a hot bath.# White dermographism: excessive redness along line of stroke with thin objecteTYPES OF ECZEMA (DERMATITIS)# Allergic contact eczema (dermatitis): A red, itchy, weepy reaction where the skin has come into contact with a substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign, such as poison ivy or certain preservatives in creams and lotions.# Atopic dermatitis: A chronic skin disease characterized by itchy, inflamed skin.# Contact eczema: A localized reaction that includes redness, itching, and burning where the skin has come into contact with an allergen (an allergy-causing substance) or with an irritant such as an acid, a cleaning agent, or other chemical.# Dyshidrotic eczema: Irritation of the skin on the palms of hands and soles of the feet characterized by clear, deep blisters that itch and bum.# Neurodermatitis: Scaly patches of the skin on the head, lower legs, wrists, or forearms caused by a localized itch (such as an insect bite) that become intensely irritated when scratched.# Nummular eczema: Coin-shaped patches of irritated skin--most common on the arms, back, buttocks, and lower legs--that may be crusted, scaling, and extremely itchy.# Seborrheic eczema: Yellowish, oily, scaly patches of skin on the scalp, face, and occasionally other parts of the body.# Stasis dermatitis: A skin irritation on the lower legs, generally related to circulatory problems.\n\n## Question from Skin:\nMultinucleate giant cells are seen in Tzank smear in ?\n* Herpesgenitalis (Correct Answer)\n* Bullous pemphigoid\n* Toxic epidermal necolysis\n* Pemphigus\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Herpes genitalis\n\n## Question from Skin:\nA 23 years old female patient presented with sever diffuse hair fall for last 1 month.

Erythropoietic porphyrias1) Erythropoietic protoporphyria2) Congenital erythropoietic porphyria3) X-linked sideroblastic anemia---++-Porphyriaso Porphyrias are heterogenous group of disorders characterized by defective metabolism of porphyrins. Porphyrins are important intermediates in biosynthesis of heme from glycine and succinyl CoA. Each step is controlled by specific enzyme. So, prophyrias are due to inherited or acquired deficiency of enzymes in heme bio-synthetic pathways (also called porphyrin pathway). They manifest with either neurological complications or skin problems (or rarely both). Based on the site of overproduction and accumulation of porphyrins, porphyrias are broadly classified asAcute (hepatic prophyria)Acute intermettant porphyria5-ALA dehydratase deficiencyHereditary CoproporphyriaVariegate porphyriaPorphyria cutanea tardaCutaneous (erythropoeitic) porphyriaErythropeitic protoporphyriaCongenital erythropoeitic porphyriaX-linked sideroblastic Anemiao The acute (hepatic) porphyrias primarily affect nervous system resulting in abdominal pain, vomiting, acute neuropathy, seizures, muscle weakenss, psychiatric/mental symptoms (i.e., Hallucination, depression, anxiety, paronoia); and autonomic nervous disturbances like hypertension, tachycardia, constipation, arrhythmias, sweating,o The cutaneous (erythropoietic) porphyrias primarily affect skin causing photosensitivity (photodermatitis) blisters, itching, maculopapular rash. There is no abdominal pain,o There are some variation in above presentation.Following two types of hepatic (acute) porphyrias also affect skin : - Hereditary coproporphyria and varigated porphyria. Therefore these two have both neuropsychiatric as well as skin manifestations.Porphyria cutanea tarda (a hepatic porphyria) does not have neuropsychiatric symptom, rather it has only skin manifestation.X-linked sideroblastic anemia (an erythropoietic porphyria) has neither neuropsychiatric nor skin symptoms.\n\n## Question from Skin:\nWood lamp is used to diagnose?\n* Psoriasis (Correct Answer)\n* Tinea versicolor\n* Pityriasis rosae\n* Erysipelas\n\nExplanation: Ans. b (Tinea versicolor).

In alopecia areata of the nails, pits are regular in size and geometrically distributed. In alopecia areata, there are patches that are perfectly smooth and without scarring. Tiny hairs 2-3 mm in length, called exclamation hairs, are usually seen in this condition. When it involves the whole scalp hair its called alopecia totalis, and when whole scalp and body hair is involved it is called alopecia universalis. Ref: Color Atlas of Nails By C.

B: Tuberous Sclerosis Tuberous sclerosis/ tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, multi-system genetic disease that causes benign tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, hea, eyes, lungs, and skin. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamain and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. The physical manifestations of tuberous sclerosis are due to the formation of hamaia (malformed tissue such as the coical tubers), hamaomas (benign growths such as facial angiofibroma and subependymal nodules) and, very rarely, cancerous hamaoblastomas. Central nervous system Classic intracranial manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include subependymal nodules and coical/ subcoical tubers. Kidneys Between 60 and 80% of TSC patients have benign tumors (hamaomas) of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas (AML) frequently causing hematuria. Lungs Patients with TSC can develop progressive replacement of the lung parenchyma with multiple cysts. This process is identical to another disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosi (LAM). Hea Rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of striated muscle. Skin The most common skin abnormalities include: - Facial angiofibromas (\"adenoma sebaceum\"): A rash of reddish spots or bumps, which appear on the nose and cheeks in a butterfly distribution. - Ungual or subungual fibromas: Small fleshy tumors that grow around and under the toenails or fingernails. - Hypomelanic macules (\"ash leaf spots\"): White or lighter patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are caused by a lack of melanin. These are usually the only visible sign of TSC at bih. In fair-skinned individuals a Wood's lamp (ultraviolet light) may be required to see them. - Forehead plaques: Raised, discolored areas on the forehead. - Shagreen patches: Areas of thick leathery skin that are dimpled like an orange peel, usually found on the lower back or nape of the neck. Eyes Retinal lesions, called astrocytic hamaomas, appear as a greyish or yellowish-white lesion in the back of the globe on ophthalmic examination.\n\n## Question from Skin:\nA 16-year-old patient was recently diagnosed with HIV.

This is an example of:\n* Stratified sampling\n* Simple random sampling\n* Cluster sampling (Correct Answer)\n* Multistage sampling\n\nExplanation: Ans. d. Multistage sampling (Ref: BK Mahajan 6/e p100-101; Park 23/e p849, 20/e p752-753)In Multistage sampling, sampling procedure is carried out in several stages using random sampling techniques.Multistage sampling is used when the population units arranged in hierarchal groups (Sampling schools, then sections, then students).In a sampling technique, every 10th unit of population is chosen. This is type of systematic random sampling.Types of Sampling Random SamplingNon-random samplingSynonyms* Probability samplingQ* Non-purposive sampling* Non -probability sampling* Purposive samplingQTypes* Simple random sampling* Systematic random sampling* Stratified random sampling* Multistage random sampling* Multiphase random sampling* Cluster random sampling* Convenience sampling* Quota sampling* Snow-ball sampling* Clinical trial samplingTypes of Random SamplingSimple Random Sampling:Every unit of population has equal and known chance of being selectedQIs also knowm as 'unrestricted random sampling'Applicable for small, homogenous and readily available populationsUsed in clinical trialsMethods of Simple random sampling* Lottery method* Random number tables* Computer softwareSystematic Random Sampling:Based on sampling fraction: Every Kth unit is chosen in the population list, where K is chosen by sampling intervalQSampling Interval (K) = Total no. of units in population/ Total no. of units in sampleApplicable for large, non-homogenous populations where complete list of individuals is availableFor example, if there is a population of 1000 from which sample of 20 is to be chosen, then K = 1000/20 - 50; thus every 50th unit will be included in the sample (i.e. 1st, 51st, 101st, so on...) First unit among first 50 is chosen by simple random sampling.Stratified Random Sampling:Non-homogenous population is converted to homogenous groups/classes (strata); sample is drawn from each strata at random, in proportion to its sizeQApplicable for large non-homogenous populationQGives more representative sample than simple random samplingQNone of the categories is under or over-representedQFor example. In a population of 1000, sample of 100 is to be drawn for Hemoglobin estimation; first convert non-homogenous population is converted to homogenous strata (i.e. 700 males and 300 females), then draw 70 males and 30 females randomly respectively.Multistage Random Sampling:Is done in successive stages: each successive sampling unit is nested in the previous sampling unitQAdvantage: Introduces flexibility in samplingQFor example, in large country surveys, states are chosen, then districts, then villages, then every 10th person in village as final sampling unitMultiphase Random Sampling:Is done in successive phases; part of information is obtained from whole sample and part from the sub-sampleQFor example, in a TB survey, Mantoux test done in first phase, then X-ray done in all Mantoux positives, then sputum examined in all those with positive X-ray findings.Cluster Random Sampling:Applicable when units of population are natural groups or clustersUse in India: Evaluation of immunization coverageQWHO technique used: 30 x 7 technique (total =210 children)QWHO technique used in CRS: 30 x 7 technique (total = 210 children)30 clusters, each containing 7 children, who are 12-23 months age and are completely immunized for primary immunization (till Measles vaccine)QClusters are heterogeneous within themselves but homogenous with respect to each other Sampling interval is also calculated in CRSAccuracyQ: Low error rate of only +- 5%Limitation: Clusters cannot be compared with each otherQTypes of Non-Random SamplingConvenience Sampling:Patients are selected, in part or in whole, at the convenience of the researcher; no/limited attempt to ensure that sample is an accurate representation of populationQFor example, standing at a shopping mall and selecting shoppers as they walk by to fill out a survey.Quota Sampling:Population is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups (quotas), just as in stratified sampling; then judgment is used to select the units from each group non-randomlyIs a type of convenience sampling.Snow-ball Sampling:A technique for developing a research sample where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances; thus the sample group appears to grow like a rolling snowballIs often used in hidden populations which are difficult for researchers to access, e.g. drug users or commercial sex workersQClinical Trial Sampling\n\n## Question from Social & Preventive Medicine:\nAll the following form part of occupational health history except –\n* History of previous occupation\n* Exposure to dust (Correct Answer)\n* Childhood immunizations\n* Safety\n\nExplanation: Pre-placement examination \n\nPre-placement examination refers to examination of a person before giving a job.\nThe purpose of preplacement examination is to place the right man in the right job, so that the warker can perform his duties efficiently without detriment to his health.\nIt is done at the time of employment and includes -\n\n\nHistory → Medical, family, occupational and social\nThorough physical examination\nBattery of biological and radiological examinations → Chest X-ray, ECG, vision testing, urine and blood examination\nSpecial tests for endemic disease\n\n## Question from Social & Preventive Medicine:\nAll of the following statements about purification of water are true except -\n* Presence of Clostridial spores indicate recent contamination of water (Correct Answer)\n* Coliforms must not be detectable in a ny 100 ml sample of drinking water\n* Sodium thiosulphate is used to neutralize chlorine\n* Coliforms may be detected by multiple tube method & indole production\n\nExplanation: Spores of Clostridium are capable of surviving in water for a longer time than the coliform group of organisms. The presence of Clostridium spores in the absence of coliform group suggest faecal contamination occurred at some remote time.

The measurement of 5-HIAA is used most frequently.* False-positive elevations may occur if the patient is eating serotonin-rich foods such as bananas, pineapples, walnuts, pecans, avocados, or hickory nuts or is taking certain medications (cough syrup containing guaifenesin, acetaminophen, salicylates, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or 1-dopa).* The normal range in daily urinary 5-HIAA excretion is 2-8 mg/d.* Most physicians use only the urinary 5-HIAA excretion rate; however, plasma and platelet serotonin levels, if available, may provide additional information.* Platelet serotonin levels are more sensitive than urinary 5-HIAA but are not generally available.* Because patients with foregut carcinoids may produce an atypical carcinoid syndrome, if this syndrome is suspected and the urinary 5-HIAA is minimally elevated or normal, other urinary metabolites of tryptophan, such as 5-HTP and 5-HT, should be measured.* Serum chromogranin A levels are elevated in 56-100% of patients with carcinoid tumors, and the level correlates with tumor bulk. Serum chromogranin A levels are not specific for carcinoid tumors.* Plasma neuron-specific enolase levels are also used as a marker of carcinoid tumors but are less sensitive than chromogranin A, being increased in only 17-47% of patients.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\n'Rule of Nine' to estimate surface area of burns was given by:\n* Moiz Kaposi (Correct Answer)\n* Alexander Wallace\n* Joseph Lister\n* Thomas Barclay\n\nExplanation: Ans.

Lymphatic metastasis occurs primarily to the axillary (75%) & internal mammary lymph nodes. Tumors in the posterior one-third of breast are more likely to drain to the internal mammary nodes. Involvement of LNs has both biological & chronological significance It represents not only an evolutional event in the spread of the carcinoma but is also a marker for the metastatic potential of that tumor Involvement of supraclavicular nodes and of any contralateral lymph nodes represents advanced disease, LN metastasis is treated by surgical dissection and radiotherapy Axillary Lymph node levels in relation with pectoralis minor Level Relation with pectoralis minor Axillary LNs included I Below or lateral Anterior, Posterior, Lateral II Posterior (behind) Central, Interpectoral (Rotter&;s nodes) III Medial or above Apical Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pgno: 853\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nMicronodular cirrhosis is commonly seen in all except,\n* Chronic hepatitis B (Correct Answer)\n* Alcoholic liver disease\n* Hemochromatosis\n* Chronic extrahepatic biliary obstruction\n\nExplanation: Chronic hepatitis B [Ref Robbin 7Th/e p. 8991 Cirrhosis of the liver is a pathological entity which clinically represents the end stage of chronic liver disease. It is characterized by three features. i) Bridging fibrous septa& in the form of delicate bands or broad scars linking poal tracts with one another and poal tracts with terminal hepatic veins. ii) Parenchymal nodulesQ containing proliferating hepatocytes encircled by fibrosis with diameters varying from very small to large. Cirrhosis is defined as micronodular or macronodular depending upon the size of parenchymal nodules Micronodular cirrhosisu - Parenchymal nodules < 3 mm in size Macronodular cirrhosisQ - Parenchymal nodules > 3 mm in size Viral hepatitis commonly causes macronodular cirrhosisdeg. In viral hepatitis the cirrhosis is characterized by irregularly large sized nodules separated by variable but mostly broad scars. This pattern of cirrhosis is historically called posnecrotic cirrhosise. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is not only applied to viral hepatitis but to all forms of cirrhosis in which the liver shows large irregular sized ntacronodules with broad scars regardless of the etiology. Also remember these Alcholic cirrhosis is typically micronodularQ, but can become macronodulare in later stages. Viral cirrhosis is typically macronodularQ. Cirrhosis associated with virus is called postnecrotic cirrhosis. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is also called posthepatitis cirrhosis macronodular cirrhosis and coarsely nodular cirrhosis. Cirrhosis in hemochromatosis is typically micronodularQ (can be macronodular sometimes). Wilson's disease causes macronodularQ cirrhosis. Biliary cirrhosis whether primary or secondary is micronodularQ.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nHeavy pressure application during mask ventilation may compress:\n* Marginal mandibular nerve.

A: Papillary carcinoma of thyroid A psammoma body is a round collection of calcium, seen microscopically. The term is derived from the Greek word psammos meaning \"sand.\" Psammoma bodies are commonly seen in ceain tumors such as: Papillary thyroid carcinoma Papillary renal cell carcinoma Serous papillary ovarian adenocarcinoma (cystadenocarcinoma) Endometrial adenocarcinomas (Papillary serous carcinoma -3%-4%) Meningioma Mesothelio ma Psammoma bodies usually have a laminar appearance.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nSuperior pulmonary sulcus carcinomas (Pancoast tumors) are bronchogenic carcinomas that typically produce which of the following clinical features?\n* Atelectasis of the involved apical segment (Correct Answer)\n* Horner syndrome\n* Pain in the T4 and T5 dermatomes\n* Nonproductive cough\n\nExplanation: Pancoast tumors are peripheral bronchogenic carcinomas that produce symptoms by involvement of extrapulmonary structures adjacent to the cupula. These structures include the nerve roots of C8 and T1, as well as the sympathetic trunk. Interruption of the cervical sympathetic trunk leads to miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis, the triad of signs that constitutes Horner syndrome. Involvement of the nerve roots causes pain along the corresponding dermatomes. The peripheral location of the neoplasm makes pulmonary signs, such as atelectasis, cough, and hemoptysis, unlikely.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nWhich among the following is the most common fatal primary blast injury?\n* Abdominal injuries\n* Brain injury (Correct Answer)\n* Pulmonary barotrauma\n* Vascular Injury\n\nExplanation: The lung is very susceptible to primary blast injury. Pulmonary barotrauma is the most common fatal primary blast injury, and the most common critical injury in people close to the blast center. Pressure differentials across the alveolar-capillary interface can cause disruption, hemorrhage, pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema. Air embolism is another well-recognized consequence of blast lung injury. It is one of the major factors leading to cardiac dysfunction and immediate death after blast wave exposure. Ref: Halpern P.

Residents do not know about it (Only God Knows)\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nMost common organism causing post-transplant lymphoma is\n* EBV (Correct Answer)\n* HHV6\n* HSV1\n* HTLV-1\n\nExplanation: Post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a well-recognized complication of both solid organ transplantation (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It is one of the most common post transplant malignancies. In most cases, PTLD is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of B cells, either as a consequence of reactivation of the virus post transplantation or from primary EBV infection; a consequence of the detrimental effect of immunosuppressive agents on the immune-control of EBV. In cases of primary infection, EBV may be acquired from the donor graft or, less commonly, from environmental exposure.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nTrue about indication of celliotomy in blunt trauma\n* Peritoneal air on imaging (Correct Answer)\n* Grade I spleen damage\n* Grade II liver damage\n* Patient with positive diagnostic lavage\n\nExplanation: Laprotomy is also called celiotomy. Indication for laprotomy in blunt trauma include signs of peritonitis, evisceration, clinical deterioration during observation & in the presence of hemodynamic instability as DPL or FAST examination consistent with hemoperitoneum. Peritoneal air on imaging is a sign of peritonitis and hence an indicaton.

On examination there is tenderness in scarpa's triangle. On flexing the hip the limb is abducted. What is the MOST likely diagnosis?\n* Pehes disease (Correct Answer)\n* Slipped capital femoral epiphyses\n* Observation hip\n* Tuberculosis hip\n\nExplanation: This condition tend to occur in adolescent obese children, and is thought to be due to hormonal predisposition. Patients usually presents with either acute or chronic hip or knee pain with an associated limp. An adolescent complaining of knee pain, paicularly if overweight has Slipped capital femoral epiphysis until proven otherwise. On examination there is restricted internal rotation of the hip and limited abduction. AP and frog leg lateral views of hips are useful in diagnosis. In the AP view, Klein's line drawn along the femoral neck shows the relative varus of the femoral epiphysis and a similar line drawn on the lateral view demonstrates the relative posterior displacement.

Extension is painful, produces an audible click, and often requires the assistance of the other hand. What is the first line treatment of the condition?\n* Splinting for 6 weeks\n* Surgery under local anaesthesia (Correct Answer)\n* Coicosteroid Injection\n* Oral NSAIDs\n\nExplanation: This is a case of trigger finger, which is most common in is most common in the sixth decade, women, people with diabetes, and the dominant hand. Trigger finger is caused by inflammation and constriction of the retinacular sheath through which the flexor tendons run as they pass from the palm of the hand into the finger. This causes irritation of the tendon, sometimes resulting in the formation of a nodule, which impinges on the pulley, causing pain and restricting movement. Treatment: Coicosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is usually the first line treatment. Up to 57% of cases resolve with one injection, and 86% with two. Surgery--Usually indicated if two coicosteroid injections six weeks apa have failed, or the finger is irreversibly locked in flexion. Surgery to release the pulley is done as a day case through a palmar incision under local anaesthetic. Cure rates approach 100%. Splinting for six weeks can decrease inflammation. This is an option for those wishing to avoid injections or surgery. Congenital triggering usually presents in the first year of life. The digit is locked in flexion or extension. Steroid injections have no role in management; instead, refer to a hand surgeon. Ref: Benson L, Ptaszek A. Injection versus surgery in the treatment of trigger finger.

LAR is done when tumor is situated 2cms from the dentate line so that 2cms of normal tissue can be resected below the dentate line. If 2cms of normal tissue cannot be resected below the tumor (but above the dentate line), APR procedure is done. Distance from the dentate line is not given among the option so distance from the anal verge is answer of choice here as dentate line is just 2cms from the anal verge.

A full thickness biopsy of the rectum was carried out. Which one of the following rectal biopsy findings is most likely to be present -\n* fibrosis of submucosa\n* Hyalinisation of the muscular coat\n* Thickened muscularis propria (Correct Answer)\n* Lack of ganglion cells\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nWhich of the following is not true about the pleomorphic adenoma of parotid gland?\n* Facial nerve involvement indicate malignancy\n* It occurs most commonly in parotid gland (Correct Answer)\n* Malignant disease is most common variety\n* Superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice\n\nExplanation: Superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice The ratio of malignant to benign tumors by the as well: parotid gland, 80% benign and 20 % malignant; Submandibular gland and sublingual gland, 50% benign and 50% malignant; and minor salivary glands, 25% benign and 75% malignant Facial nerve palsy is an infrequent presenting complaint and indicate malignancy. Pleomorphic adenoma (mixed tumor): This is the commonest tumor of the major salivary gland and its marked feature id histological diversity. It is called mixed because beside epithelial element there is also myxoid, hyline, chondroid (cailaginous) and even osseous bone. About 90% of pleomorphic adenoma is seen in parotid gland ,7% is seen in submandibular gland. tail of the parotid is commonest location in the tail of parotid. Nature of tumor: It is basically a benign tumor. Recurrence rate, which is repoed to be high, was mostly due to fault in the surgical technique in the form of simple enucleation which was often used earlier. The incidence of malignant transformation increases with the duration of the tumor, being 2% for tumors present with less than 5 years duration and 10% for those of more than 15 years duration. Treatment: This tumor is radioresistant, so excision is treatment of choice. Superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice, this operation is known as patey's operation. In case of submandibular gland neoplasm, the whole gland is excised with paicular care to preserve the lingual and hypoglossal nerve.

She receives chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and is on tamoxifen. Recommended follow-up after therapy should always include:\n* Blood tumor markers drawn every 3-6 months after treatment.\n* Routine monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) every 3-6 months after treatment.\n* Yearly bone scans. (Correct Answer)\n* Routine clinical examination every 3-6 months for the first 5 years after treatment as well as continued yearly mammography.\n\nExplanation: Follow-up after breast cancer treatment is very variable. There is no consensus and no follow-up test has shown a survival advantage. Routine 3-6-month clinical examinations and yearly mammography should always be performed. The use of tumor markers such as a CA15-3has not shown any proven significant value and may lead to unnecessary worry.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nOne of the common fractures that occur during boxing by hitting with a closed fist is ?\n* Monteggia fracture dislocation\n* Galeazzi fracture dislocation (Correct Answer)\n* Bennett's fracture dislocation\n* Smith's fracture\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Bennett's fracture dislocation The common mechanism of injury for Benett's fracture is an axial blow directed against the paially flexed metacarpal, in most cases during 'fist fights'. Benett's fracture Benett's fracture is an intra-aicular fracture dislocation of the palmar base of first metacarpal bone of the thumb with either subluxation or dislocation of first carpometacarpal joint, i.e. trapezometacarpal joint. The common mechanism of injury is an axial blow directed against the paially flexed metacarpal, in most cases during \"Fist fights \". Patient complains of pain, swelling and tenderness over the base of the thumb. Movements of thumb are restricted. Displacing force in Bennett's fractures Following are the deforming forces in Bennett's fracture :- i) At the distal fragment, it is the adductor pollicis. ii) At the proximal fragment, it is the abductor pollicis longus. Base of the thumb metacarpal is pulled dorsally and medially by the abductor pollicis longus, while the distal attachment of adductor pollicis fuher levers the base into abduction.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\n30 yrs female presented with unilateral breast cancer associated with axillary lymph node enlargement. Modified\nradical\nmastectomy was done, a further treatment plan will be\n* Observation and follow-up\n* Adriamycin based chemotherapy only (Correct Answer)\n* Adriamycin based chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen depending on estrogen/progesterone receptor status\n* Tamoxifen only\n\nExplanation: Stage I & II breast cancers (Early invasive breast cancers ) are managed by\n1. Primary therapy for local management \n2. Adjuvant therapy Primary therapy consists of:\nMastectomy with an assessment of axillary lymph node status (or modified radical mastectomy) or Breast conservation (lumpectomy, wide local excision or quadrantectomy) with an assessment of axillary lymph node status + radiotherapy.\nVarious trials have found both these methods to be equally effective. Breast conservation is the preferred form of treatment because of cosmetic advantages. However, there are certain contraindications for conservative surgery (described in subsequent question) Management of axillary lymph nodes Earlier dissection of axillary lymph nodes (level I and II) was performed to assess the lymph node status (i.e. presence or absence of occult metastasis). Now Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the standard for evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes for metastasis in women who have clinically negative lymph nodes, (the sentinel lymph node is thirst regional lymph node to receive tumor cells that metastasize along the lymphatic pathway from the primary breast cancer). Axillary Lymph node dissection is performed for clinically palpable axillary lymph nodes or metastatic disease detected in sentinel lymph node biopsy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node-negative cancers if > 1 cm in size.\n\nNode-negative cancer > .5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion high nuclear grade high histological grade HER 2/neuoverexpression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive tumors. HER-2/neu expression is determined for all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and may be used to provide prognostic information in patients with node-negative breast cancer and predict the relative efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab is the HER-2/neu-targeted agent that is added to the adjuvant therapy is the tumor shows overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors. Advanced Local-Regional Breast Cancer (Stage III ) (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + MRM + adjuvant radiation therapy + chemotherapy + antiestrogen therapy)\n\nHere the disease is advanced on the chest wall or in regional lymph nodes (or both), with no evidence of metastasis to distant sites.\nSuch patients are recognized to be at significant risk for the development of subsequent metastases, and treatment addresses the risk for both local and systemic relapse. In an effort to provide optimal local-regional disease-free survival as well as distant disease-free survival for these women, surgery is integrated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy (administration of therapeutic agents prior to the main treatment) should be considered in the initial management of all patients with locally advanced stage III breast cancer. Surgical therapy for women with stage III disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) is added for hormone receptor-positive tumors.\nChemotherapy is used to maximize distant disease-free survival, whereas radiation therapy is used to maximize local-regional disease-free survival.\nIn selected patients with stage IIIA cancer, neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy can reduce the size of primary cancer and permit breast-conserving surgery.\nDistant Metastases (Stage IV ) (mainly palliative treatment) Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative but may prolong survival and enhance a woman’s quality of life.\nHormonal therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy.\nAppropriate candidates for initial hormonal therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers; women with bone or soft tissue metastases only; and women with limited and asymptomatic visceral metastases.\nSystemic chemotherapy is indicated for women with hormone receptor-negative cancers, symptomatic visceral metastases, and hormone-refractory metastases. Bisphosphonates, which may be given in addition to chemotherapy or hormone therapy, should be considered in women with bone metastases. About Adjuvant Therapy, Adjuvant therapy is the use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or/and hormone therapy) in patients who have received local therapy but are at risk of relapse.\nThe objective is to eliminate the occult metastasis responsible for late recurrences while they are microscopic and theoretically most vulnerable to anticancer agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node-negative cancers if > 1 cm in size node-negative cancer > .5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion high nuclear grade high histological grade HER 2/neuover expression negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive.\n\nThe use of chemotherapy in postmenopausal women is controversial. In postmenopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently.\n\n In estrogen-positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen / aromatase inhibitors)\nTherapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy it involves the administration of adjuvant therapy before primary therapy (surgery & radiation therapy) it has shown to down-stage the tumor. Previously CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate & 5 - fluorouracil) was the chemotherapeutic regimen of choice. “CMF is no longer considered adequate adjuvant chemotherapy and modem regimens include an anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and the newer agents such as the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel)”- Bailey and Love 25/e p844 Anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy.\n(Trastuzumab) HER-2/neu expression for all newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer is now recommended. Trastuzumab is added to the chemotherapy for tumors overexpressing HER-2/neu receptors (Trastuzumab is added along with taxanes).\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nThe most common type of Tracheo - Oesophageal Fistula is\n* Esophageal atresia without tracheosophageal fistula\n* Esophageal atresia with proximal tracheoesophageal fistula (Correct Answer)\n* Esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophagea fistula\n* Esophageal atresia with proximal and distal fistula\n\nExplanation: Tracheo-oesophageal fistula, associated with VACTER abnormalities.there are 5 types of which their incidences are as follows type A)atresia without fistula( 8.5%) type B)atresia with proximal TOF(1%) type C)atresia with distal TOF(85%) type D)atresia with both proximal and distal TOF(1.5%) type E)no atresia but H type TOF(4%) Ref: SRB&;s manual of surgery,5th ed, pg no 803\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nPericoronitis is seen in relation to\n* Impacted third molars only (Correct Answer)\n* Around incompletely erupted crown\n* Completely erupted crowns only\n* None of the above\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nA 30 years old male comes to oho emergency with his 3 years old daughter who is crying.

D: 20 kg Traction is usually applied to the spine, pelvis, neck, arms, or legs. The force is generated by weight or force against the weight of the body. The two main types of traction are skin traction and skeletal traction. Of these two types, many specialized forms have been developed to treat conditions in specific pas of the body. With skin traction, weights are attached to the skin, which applies the pulling force to the bone. It is used when light (3 to 4 kg) or sho-term traction is needed. With skeletal traction, pins are attached to the bone so that the pulling force is applied directly to the bone. Skeletal traction is used when skin traction is not possible and when greater weight (upto 20 kg) is needed.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nWhich of the following will cause oral cancers?\n* Syphilitic glossitis\n* EBV\n* НPV (Correct Answer)\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: EBV, HPV and syphilis will cause oral cancers.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nRisk of ovarian carcinoma with BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutation is:\n* <5%\n* 10% (Correct Answer)\n* 30%\n* 60%\n\nExplanation: The risk of ovarian cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers ranges from 20 to 40%, which is 10 times higher than that in the general population.

Das Textbook of Surgery 5th/1036\"A rectal biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. In the newborn period, this is done at the bedside with minimal morbidity using a special suction rectal biopsy instrument. It is importantto obtain the sample at least 2 cm above the dentate line to avoid sampling the normal transition from ganglionated bowel to the paucity or absence of ganglia in the region of the internal sphincter. In older children, because the rectal mucosa is thicker, a full-thickness biopsy is obtained under general anesthesia. Absent ganglia, hypertrophied nerve trunks, and robust immunostaining for acetylcholinesterase are the pathologic criteria to make the diagnosis\"-Sobiston 18th/2065\"Rectal suction biopsies are the procedure of choice & should be performed no closer than 2cm to the dentate line to avoid the normal area of hypoganglionosis at the anal verge\"-Nelson 18th/1566\"The definitive diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease is made by rectal biopsy. Samples of mucosa and submucosa are obtained at 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm from the dentate line\"-Schwartz 8th\"Definitive diagnosis is made by rectal biopsy. Mucosal and submucosal biopsies may be taken from the posterior rectal wall with a suction biopsy capsule without anesthesia at the bedside. Serial sections may demonstrate the characteristic lack of ganglion cells and proliferation of nerve trunks in Meissner's plexus.

Secretion of intermediate peptide growth factors also plays a part.Pathology - Affects both glandular epithelium & connective tissue stroma to variable degrees.Adenosis, epitheliosis and stromal proliferation on different proportions.Zonal or surgical division of prostate3 distinct zonesa) The peripheral zone - 70% volume of young adult prostate (Ca Prostate commonly arise here)b) The central zone - 25%c) The transition zone - 5% (BPH most commonly arise here)Medical management of BPHa) a-Adrenergic blockers - e.g.; Prazosin. Terazosin (al blockers) & Tamsulosin (a la blocker). Activation of al receptors in the bladder neck, prostrate & urethra increase their smooth muscle tone, their blockade relaxes these structures, reducing the dynamic obstruction & increasing the urine flow rate.b) 5 a reductase inhibitor - e.g.; Finasteride.Prevent conversion of testosterone to more active dihydrotestosterone responsible for androgenic action in many tissues including prostrate. It results in reduction in size of gland and improvement in symptoms. 6 months therapy is required.Notes - a- blockers afford faster and greater symptomatic relief than finasteride.Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH# Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal).# Recurrent UTI from BPH.# Bladder stones due to BPH.# Renal insufficiency due to BPH.# Larger bladder diverticula secondary to BPH.# Recurrent gross hematuria from BPH.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nTrue about diagnosis of pancreatitis is\n* Serum lipase in investigation of choice (Correct Answer)\n* CECT is done after 72 hours\n* RANSON’s score of more than 2 is acute severe pancreatitis\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: CECT is IOC for pancreatitis usually done after 72 hrs to assess severity.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nA patient of burns should be given\n* 5% dextrose\n* Hypertonic saline 0.9%\n* Dextrose saline (Correct Answer)\n* Human albumin 4.5%\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nMost common site of lentigo maligna melanoma is\n* face (Correct Answer)\n* legs\n* trunks\n* soles\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nAll are true about the condition shown except:\n* Cysts increase in size with age\n* Spider leg deformity\n* Anemia (Correct Answer)\n* Low Renin due to pressure atrophy of JG apparatus\n\nExplanation: Ans.

There is less evidence of spread of cancers from extra-pelvic origins, such as lung cancer.\n\n## Question from Surgery:\nMost common immediate complication of splenctomy:\n* Hemorrhage (Correct Answer)\n* Fistula\n* Bleeing from gastric mucosa\n* Pancreatitis\n\nExplanation: When splenectomy is performed, we are prone to injure the tail of pancreas, there is a high chance of Acute pancreatitis to occur or a duct maybecut leading to fistula. Sometimes, the blood may be collected below the diaphragm which may lead to sub-diaphragmatic abscess. Since, the spleen is in relation to the left dome of the diaphragm, due to pain post-operatively there is ipsilateral collapse of left lung leading to ATELECTASIS. Generally, after splenectomy, there is a rise in platelet count- if indicated for ITP, the patient is immobilized which increases the risk of DVT & Embolism. Complications of Splenectomy are: - 1. Lung related complications of Splenectomy: ATELECTASIS MC REACTIVE PLEURAL EFFUSION CONSOLIDATION 2. Pancreas related complications: ACUTE PANCREATITIS INJURY TO TAIL OF PANCREAS PANCREATIC FISTULA 3. Diaphragm related complications: SUB-DIAPHRAGMATIC ABCESS 4.

Clots may persist when the mass of clot is too large to be liquified by the fibrinolysin available at the site of clot formation.\nIn some deaths associated with infection and cachexia, this fibrinolytic effect may fail to develop, explaining the presence of abundant clot in the bean and large calibre vessels.\nThus, in cases of sudden death the blood remains spontaneously coagulable only during a brief period immediately following death; it then becomes completely free from fibrinogen and will never again clot. This incoagulability of the blood is a commonplace observation at autopsy.\nThe normal colour of areas of post mortem lividity is a cyanotic hue, but this description should not be used since it is misleading. The development of lividity is too variable to serve as a useful indicator of the time of death.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nThe advantage of LSCS are all EXCEPT:\n* Lateral extension (Correct Answer)\n* Less blood loss\n* Minimal wound hematoma\n* Less chance of gutter formation\n\nExplanation: ANSWER: (A) Lateral extension REF: Dutta 6th ed p. 595 ADVANTAGES OF LSCS Less blood loss Perfect apposition Less peritoneal infections Less morbid Better apposition of margins Minimal wound hematoma Less chance of gutter formation 8, Lateral extension of the incision leading to hemorrhage is a complication or disadvantage of LSCS\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nImmunoglobulin changes in variable region-\n* Idiotype (Correct Answer)\n* Isotype\n* Allotype\n* Epitope\n\nExplanation: Variability of amino acid sequences at the variable regions form the specific antigen binding site, i.e. idiotype.\n \nThe aminoacid sequences of the variable regions arc not uniformly variable along their length, but consist of relatively invariable and some highly variable zones. The highly variable zones are involved with the formation of antigen binding sites. The sites on the hyervariable regions that make actual contact with the epitopes are called \"complementarity determining regions (CDRs)\n \n\"The idiotype is defined as the specific region of the fab portion of the Ig molecule to which antigen binds\".\n \nThe infinite range of the antibody specificity of immunoglobulin depends on the variability of the aminoacid sequences at the variable regions of the H and L chains which form the antigen combining sites.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nSecond order neurons in the optical pathway are present in -\n* Bipolar cells (Correct Answer)\n* Lateral geniculate body\n* Photoreceptors\n* Superior colliculus\n\nExplanation: Ans- A Bipolar cells *ORDER OF NEURONS IN VISUAL PATHWAY* First order -Photoreceptors Second order - Bipolar cells Third order - Ganglion cells(so, optic nerve) Fourth order - LGB(so, optic radiation)\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nAcetic acid staining of cervix shows the following EXCEPT:\n* Squamous metaplasia\n* Cervical carcinoma in situ (Correct Answer)\n* Cervical polyp\n* Cervical dysplasia\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'c' ie Cervical polyp While performing a colposcopy, after visualization with naked eyes, acetic acid is applied for better visualization.The application of acetic acid coagulates the proteins of the nucleus and cytoplasm and makes the protein opaque and white.The acetic acid does not affect mature, glycogen producing epithelium.The cells which contain a large amount of protein are most affected.So dysplastic cells and cancerous cells which contains a large amount of protein (chromatin) are most affected.Metaplastic cells are also somewhat affected because the metaplastic epithelium is thin, it does not turn white or opaque but instead appears grey.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nUnder EMCP  launched in 1997,the criteria for selection of PHCs included the following EXCEPT:\n* API more than 2 for the last 3 years\n* Plasmodium falciparum more than 30% of total malaria cases\n* The area has been reporting deaths (Correct Answer)\n* The area has been reporting epidemics\n\nExplanation: Under EMCP (Enhanced Malaria Control Project) launched in 1997, the criteria for selection of PHCs (Primary Health Center) include API more than 2 for the last 3 years, Plasmodium falciparum more than 30% of total malaria cases and the area has been reporting deaths.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nAll of the following cause high anion gap acidosis EXCEPT\n* Starvation\n* Diabetic ketoacidosis\n* Methyl alcohol ingestion (Correct Answer)\n* Glue sniffing\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nIn Corynebacterium diphtheria\n* Deep invasion is not seen\n* Elek’s test is done for toxigenicity\n* Metachromatic granules are seen (Correct Answer)\n* Toxigenicity is mediated by chromosomal change\n\nExplanation: • Diphtheria acts by its toxin and invasion is not seen.\n• Elekc gel precipitation test is done for determination of pathogenicity of diphtheria.\n• Metachromatic granules are seen also called as Babes earnest granules. Bacteriophages (extra-chromosomal) are responsible for toxigenicity by phage conversion.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nCorona Radiata of ovum is formed from -\n* Cumulus ovaricus\n* Zona pellucida\n* Formative yolk (Correct Answer)\n* Follicular cells\n\nExplanation: Ans - D\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nDysphagia lusoria is most commonly caused by-\n* Aberrant Hemiazygous vein (Correct Answer)\n* Aberrant right subclavian artery\n* Enlarged mediastinal nodes\n* Thymoma in mediastinum\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., Aberrant right subclavian artery o Has been explained in previous sessions.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nWhich of the following is not true about Bell's palsy?\n* Acute onset (Correct Answer)\n* Always recurrent\n* Spontaneous remission\n* Increased predisposition in Diabetes Mellitus\n\nExplanation: Bells PalsyIt is the commonest cause of facial palsy in adultsLower motor neuron type paralysisIt is idiopathic in naturedegBells palsy manifests as an acute, unilateral paresis or paralysis of the face.The onset and evolution are rapid - typically less than 48 hours. The incidence reaches a maximum between the ages 15 and 45 years. It has a predominance in women younger than 20 years and a slight predominance in men older than 40 years, although it is more or less equaLdegRecurrence rate of Bells palsy is 4.5-15% Familial incidence = 4.1%Bells palsy is uncommon in pregnancy, however the prognosis is significantly worse in pregnant women with Bells palsy than among non pregnant women with palsy.Several authors have also demonstrated, a correlation between diabetes mellitus and Bells palsy in developing countries.Infectious causes have also been implicated in the origin of Bells palsy - viz:FISV 1 and HSV 2, human herpesVaricella zoster virusInfluenza BAdenovirusCox sackie virus- Epstein Barr virusRecently it has been demonstrated that an inactivated intranasal influenza vaccine increased the risk of Bells palsy.Normal function is usually regained within 3 months in about 2/3 rd of patientsNo fuher recovery is expected after a period of 6 months.Majority of the patients with Bell's palsy recover completelySurgical decompression of facial nerve in Bells palsy is needed only in indicated cases, i.e.In case of complete paralysis andIf electroneurography of facial nerve shows >90% of degeneration. When done it should be within 2 weeks of onset of palsy.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nAntiplatelet drug acting via purinergic receptors, not largely impacted by CYP2C19 polymorphism is:\n* Ticlopidine (Correct Answer)\n* Prasugrel\n* Clopidogrel\n* Abciximab\n\nExplanation: Ref.

Miliary tuberculosis is most prominent in the liver, bone marrow, spleen, adrenals, meninges, kidneys, fallopian tubes, and epididymis, but could involve any organ.o Miliary pulmonary disease occurs when organisms draining through lymphatics enter the venous blood and circulate back to the lung.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nNumber of Milk teeth are\n* 8\n* 16 (Correct Answer)\n* 20\n* 32\n\nExplanation: 20 (Deciduous teeth)\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nRiehl’s melanosis involves\n* Face and neck (Correct Answer)\n* Trunk\n* Extremities\n* Palms only\n\nExplanation: Riehl’s melanosis (pigmented contact dermatitis) involves face and neck\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nMost common cause of urinary ascites -\n* Post urethral valve (Correct Answer)\n* B/L PUJ obstruction\n* Meatal stenosis\n* Infantile PKD\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Post urethral valve o Forty percent of neonatal ascites is caused by urinary conditions. Urinary' ascites occurs when high intraluminal pressure forces urine to extravasate from the kidney, usually across a renal fornix. Urine then enters the retroperitoneum and travels across the peritoneum as a transudate. o If this urine or ascetic fluid is aspirated from the peritoneal cavity, the ascites or extravasated urine contains electrolyte and creatinine levels similar to those of serum. This is because the urine within the peritoneum is subject to the large absorptive mesothelial surface that quickly normalizes these values, masking the identity of ascitic fluid as urine. The diagnosis of urinary'- ascites may be difficult and may require definitive upper tract drainage in the form of nephrostomy tubes to establish the cause of the ascites and allow' its resolution, o Urinary ascites in the case of distal obstruction may serve to lower urinary pressures and offers some protection to the developing kidneys. \"Posterior urethral valves are probably the most common underlying etiology\" - Campbell's Urology\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nFlame cells are seen in\n* Multiple myeloma (Correct Answer)\n* Malignant melanoma\n* Nodular colloid goiter\n* Hashimoto thyroiditis\n\nExplanation: Multiple myeloma usually presents as destructive plasma cell tumors (plasmacytomas) involving the axial skeleton. Relatively normal-appearing plasma cells, plasma blasts with vesicular nuclear chromatin and a prominent single nucleolus, or bizarre, multinucleated cells may predominate. Other cytologic variants stem from the dysregulated synthesis and secretion of Ig, which often leads to intracellular accumulation of intact or partially degraded protein. Such variants include flame cells with fiery red cytoplasm, Mott cells with multiple grapelike cytoplasmic droplets, and cells containing a variety of other inclusions, including fibrils, crystalline rods, and globules. The globular inclusions are referred to as Russell bodies (if cytoplasmic) or Dutcher bodies (if nuclear). In advanced disease, plasma cell infiltrates may be present in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, and other soft tissues.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nMees lines are seen in?\n* Arsenic poisoning (Correct Answer)\n* Lead poisoning\n* Iodine poisoning\n* Phosphorus\n\nExplanation: ANSWER: (A) Arsenic poisoningREF: Parikh 6th Ed Pg 9.11See APPENDIX-42 for \"ANTIDOTES &TOXICOLOGY\"Repeat Forensic medidne 2013 Sessionl, 2012 Session 1, December 2011, 2007\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nWhich one of the following statements truly represents Bell's paralysis:\n* Hemiparesis and contralateral facial nerve paralysis\n* Combined paralysis of the facial, trigeminal, and abducens nerves (Correct Answer)\n* Idiopathic ipsilateral paralysis of the facial nerve\n* Facial nerve paralysis with a dry eye\n\nExplanation: Bells paralysis is a LMN type of facial nerve palsy of unknown etiology i.e. idiopathic nature.Lower motor neuron type of palsy causes ipsilateral paralysis therefore bells palsy causes ipsilateral facial paralysis.Other neurological examinations are normal in Bells palsy\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nWhich of the following is not a cause of absent ankle jerks and up-going plantars?\n* Freidreich’s ataxia\n* B12 deficiency (Correct Answer)\n* MS\n* Cord compression\n\nExplanation: Causes of absent ankle jerks and upgoing plantars is a common question as it implies both upper and lower motor neuron involvement. The more common single causes include cord compression involving both the cord (UMN) and nerve ganglia roots (LMN) as well as subacute combined degeneration of the cord. Other more common causes include the presence of more than one pathology, e.g. stroke (UMN) with superimposed peripheral neuropathy (LMN) — usually in a diabetic patient. In Friedrich’s ataxia, both cord and peripheral nerve involvement accompany cerebellar degeneration. These patients also have sensory loss, pescavus and may have complications such as diabetes and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Multiple sclerosis may cause a mixture of pyramidal signs (UMN), sensory loss (dorsal columns) and ataxia (cerebellum), but will never involve the LMN.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nWhich portion of MHC 1 complex forms the component of antigen presenting part :\n* Between alpha 1 – beta 2 microglobulin (Correct Answer)\n* Distal part of alpha chain\n* Proximal part of alpha chain\n* Between aS and b2 microglobulin\n\nExplanation: Antigen Presenting part of MHC\nMHC I/HLAI :\nClass 1 molecule consists of a three domains of heavy alpha peptide chain (a1 ; a2; a3) which are non-covalently linked to smaller\nβ2 microglobulin peptide.\nThe distal domain (alpha 1 and alpha 2) of MCH 1 have highly variable amino acid sequences and are folded to form a cavity or groove.\nProtein antigens are bound to this groove for presentation to CD8 T cells. MHC II/HLA II :\nMHC II antigens are heterodimer consisting of an alpha and beta chain. Each chain has two domain proximal one is constant and distal one is variable.\nThe two distal domain (alpha 1, beta 1) constitute the antigen binding site, for recognition by CD4 T cells.\nBoth class 1 and class 2 are members of immunoglobulin gene super family.\nMHC III /HLA III\n§ MHC III are heterogenous they include complement components involved in the formation of C3 convertase, heat shock protein and tumor necrosis factor.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nSound intensity required to elicit stapedial reflexis more than:\n* 45 - 65 db (Correct Answer)\n* 70 - 90 db\n* 90 - 100 db\n* 30 - 45 db\n\nExplanation: - The pure tone intensity range to elicit an acoustic reflex is 70 to 100dBHL\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nMost important drug for persistors of TB :\n* Rifampicin (Correct Answer)\n* Pyrazinamide\n* INH\n* Ethambutol\n\nExplanation: Rifampicin (RMP)\nRMP is a powerful bactericidal drug. It is a better sterilizing agent than INH. It permeates all tissue membranes including the blood – brain and placental barriers. It is equally effective against intracellular as well as extracellular bacilli.\nIt is the only bactericidal drug active against the “persisters” or dormant bacilli which are found in the solid caseous lesions, all other drugs being inactive. In this regard, it has a distinct advantage over INH.\nRifampicin is of special value when the bacilli resists other drugs. In combination with INH, it can cure even extensive tuberculosis in about 9 months.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA 20-day old neonate presented with history of non-passage of meconium along with rectal prolapse, poor growth and delayed maturation.

What is the Neonatal mortality rate?\n* 50 (Correct Answer)\n* 62.5\n* 12.5\n* 49.4\n\nExplanation: Total number of births in one year = 4050\nNo. of still births in that year = 50\nHence, total number of live births in that year would be\n4050 – 50\n4000\nTotal number of infants dying in the first 7 days = 50 Total number of infants dying in the next 21 days = 150\nHence, total number of infants dying in the first 28 days of birth\n= 50 + 150 Now,\nNeonatal mortality rate = 50\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA Man is hit by a car and is thrown up and hits the road divider, then falls on the ground, sustains a head injury, then run over by another car. Cause of head injury is: (D. REPEAT Feb 2014)\n* Primary impact injury\n* Secondary impact injury\n* Primary injury (Correct Answer)\n* Secondary injury\n\nExplanation: Ans:D (Secondary injury) Ref: Textbook of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, 1999, Nageshwar Rao, pg: 207 Explanation: Pedestrians can sustain three types of injuries during a road traffic accident Primary Impact Injury - To the first part struck by the vehicle,''object. Secondary Impact Injury - Caused by further impact to the vehicle by the victim. Tertiary Impact Injury (Secondary Injury) when the victim strikes another object or ground. Primary Impact Injury When a moving vehicle hits a person, various parts of the vehicle will come into contact with body during the impact, producing patterned injuries called primary impact injuries. The parts of the vehicle which produce patterned injuries are bumpers, grills, headlights etc. A hit by bumper of the car produces fracture of leg bones, called bumper fracture. The detection of primary impact injury will help to find out the relative position of the vehicle and the pedestrian. Primary impact injury can serve as an important evidence for the mechanism of trauma. Secondary Impact Injury After the primary impact, the feet of the victim slide, whole body is lifted off the ground and the victim is thrown onto the vehicle. The head may strike the windshield and torso may strike the bonnet or other parts of the car. After the secondary impact the victim is thrown onto the ground. Secondary Injury The victim striking the ground causes these injuries. It also includes injuries caused by run over by other vehicles. Head injury is the most common injury. The victim may also be sometimes run over by the vehicle producing crush injuries.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nAll are primary supports of uterus except\n* Transcervical ligament\n* Pubocervical ligament\n* Uterosacral (Correct Answer)\n* Broad ligament\n\nExplanation: The supports of the uterus and the bladder are seen to be triradiate condensation of endopelvic fascia:\n \nThe anterior spoke is the pubocervical fascia or so-called pubocervical ligament.\n \nThe lateral spoke is Mackenrodt's ligament.\n \nThe posterior spoke is the uterosacral ligament.\n \nSUPPORTS OF THE GENITAL TRACT\n \nDeLancey introduced three level systems of support.

The most appropriate therapy for her would be -\n* Radioiodine therapy\n* Total thyroidectomy\n* Carbtmazole parenteral (Correct Answer)\n* Propylthiouracil oral\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., Propylthiouracil oral o Graves' disease. an autoimmune disease characterized by antibodies against the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (also called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins), is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Treatment of Graves disease o The therapeutic approach to Graves' hyperthyroidism consists of both # Rapid amelioration of symptoms with a beta-blocker # Measures aimed at decreasing thyroid hormone synthesis: the administration of a thionamide, radioiodine ablation, or surgery. i) Amelioration of symptoms Beta-blockers o Beta-blockers ameliorate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism that are caused by increased beta-adrenergic tone. o These include palpitations, tachycardia, tremulousness, anxiety, and heat intolerance. o Thus, a beta-blocker should be started (assuming there are no contraindications to its use) in most patients as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made, even before obtaining a 24-hour radioiodine uptake. ii) Drugs and measures used to decrease thyroid hormone synthesis Thionamides o The thioamide methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the primary drugs used to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism. o Methimazole is preferred because of its longer duration of action, allowing for once-daily dosing, more rapid efficacy, and lower incidence of side effects. o PTU is preferred during the first trimester of pregnancy because of the potential teratogenic effects of methimazole. o The goal of thionamide therapy in Graves' hyperthyroidism is to attain a euthyroid state within three to eight weeks. o This can be followed by ablative therapy with radioiodine or surgery' or by continuation of the drug for a prolonged period (usually one to two years) with the hope of attaining a permanent remission. iodinated contrast agents and pine o Patients who have severe hyperthyroidism or are allergic to thionamides may benefit from alternative medical therapies. o The oral radiocontrast agent's sodium iodate and iopanoic acid are potent inhibitors of the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. o They are not used as primary therapy because of possible induction of resistant hyperthyroidism, o However, when given in combination with methimazole (at doses of500 to 1000 mg/day), they can rapidly ameliorate severe hyperthyroidism and can also be used to prepare a hyperthyroid patient for early surgery. Other medications - o A number of other medications have been used in the management of hyperthyroidism, including the following: o Glucocorticoids Inhibit peripheral T4 to T3 conversion and, in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, reduce thyroid secretion. They have been used in patients with severe hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm, although their efficacy is not well demonstrated. o Lithium Blocks thyroid hormone release, but its use has been limited by its toxicity. o Cholestyramine Given in a dose of 4 g four times daily with methimazole, lowers serum T4 and T3 concentrations more rapidly than methimazole alone, and may be useful adjunctive therapy in selected patients who require rapid amelioration of hyperthyroid symptoms. o Carnitine # Is a naturally occurring peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action that has been shown to ameliorate hyperthyroid symptoms and may prove to be useful clinically. o Rituximab A monoclonal antibody that causes peripheral B cell depletion, may induce a sustained remission in patients with Graves' disease and low TRAb levels, but its cost and side effects limit its utility. Radioiodine ablation o Radioiodine is widely used for the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. o It has been the therapy of choice. o Although a thionamide provides control of hyperthyroidism as long as the drug is taken, the persistent remission rate when the drug is discontinued one to two years later averages only about 30 percent. However, there are patients in whom it may be reasonable to delay radioiodine (or surgery). Included in this group are patients with mild hyperthyroidism and patients with small goiters or with goiters that shrink during thionamide therapy. o Radioiodine is administered as a capsule or, less commonly, an oral solution of sodium 1311, which is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and concentrated in thyroid tissue. o It induces extensive tissue damage, resulting in ablation of the thyroid within 6 to 18 weeks. The goal of radioiodine therapy is the destruction of the gland, with the early development of hypothyroidism. This eliminates the risk of recurrent hyperthyroidism. Surgery o Surgery is an unpopular therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism, being selected by only 1 percent of thyroid specialists. o It is primarily indicated in patients who have an obstructive goiter or a very large goiter, in patients with active ophthalmopathy who desire definitive therapy for their hyperthyroidism, in pregnant women who are allergic to antithyroid drugs, and in patients who have allergies or poor compliance on antithyroid drugs but refuse radioiodine. Surgery would also be indicated if there was a coexisting suspicious or malignant thyroid nodule or primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nEutectic lignocaine-prilocaine has the following unique property\n* It causes motor blockade without sensory block (Correct Answer)\n* By surface application, it can anaesthetize unbroken skin\n* It is not absorbed after surface application\n* It has strong vasoconstrictor action\n\nExplanation: Lignocaine or prilocaine cannot anaesthetize intact skin.\nEutectic mixture is the combination of equal proportions of lignocaine and prilocaine at 25° C.\nThis mixture has a lower melting point than any of the two ingredients.

(a) Prolonged QT interval.The rate is bradycardic at 54 beats/min. Ihe rhythm is regular with a narrow QRS and normal-appearing sinus P waves are seen. Axis is normal.The QT interval is very prolonged to more than 600 milliseconds with a long, isoelectric ST segment (best seen in lead V6) and T-wave inversions in leads I, aVL, and VI through V5.There are Q waves in leads VI through V3 consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. The clinical history coupled with ECG findings of a long QT and isoelectric ST segment are classic for hypocalcemia. If left untreated, hypocalcemia can progress to tetany and cardiovascular collapse. The long QT interval and sinus bradycardia predispose this patient to torsades de pointes.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nCarpal tunnel contains all except -\n* Median nerve\n* FDS tendon\n* FPL tendon (Correct Answer)\n* FCU tendon\n\nExplanation: Ans-D\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nIf a doctor gives a false medical certificate to a patient, he is liable to be prosecuted under which section of the IPC?\n* 137\n* 147\n* 167 (Correct Answer)\n* 197\n\nExplanation: Ans is 'd' i.e. 197 Section 197 in the Indian Penal Code:Issuing or signing false certificate Whoever issues or signs any certificate required by law to be given or signed, or relating to any fact of which such certificate is by law admissible in evidence, knowing or believing that such certificate is false in any material point, shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave false evidence.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nIn Alzheimer's disease, the plaque is made up of: (E. REPEAT 2010)-\n* Tau protein (Correct Answer)\n* Beta amyloid\n* Huntington\n* Alpha synnuclein\n\nExplanation: Ans-BRef: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease. 8th edition. Pages 1313-7Explanation:MORPHOLOGY OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASECortical atrophy especially in frontal, temporal and parietal lobes.Compensatory ventricular enlargement due to loss of parenchyma and reduced brain volume - (hydrocephalus ex vacuo).Structures involved early - medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala.The major microscopic abnormalities: o Neuritic (senile) plaques.o Neurofibrillary tangles.Progressive severe neuronal loss and reactive gliosis.Neuritic PlaquesFocal, spherical collections of dilated, tortuous, neuritic processes (dystrophic neurites) often around a central amyloid core, surrounded by a clear halo.Size from 20 to 200 mm in diameter.Microglial cells and reactive astrocytes are present at their periphery.Plaques are found in the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex.The amyloid core, stained by Congo Red. contains several abnormal proteins.The dominant component of the amyloid plaque core is Ab. a peptide derived from, amyloid precursor protein (APP).Other proteins include:o Components of the complement cascadeo Pro-inflammatory cytokineso al-antichymotrypsino Apolipoproteins.Neurofibrillary TanglesBundles of filaments in the cytoplasm of the neurons that displace or encircle the nucleus.In pyramidal neurons, they have an elongated \"flame\" shape: in rounder cells, the basket weave of fibers around the nucleus takes a rounded contour (\"globose\" tangles).H&E staining: Basophilic fibrillar structures.Very well demonstrated by silver (Bielschowsky) staining.They are commonly found in cortical neurons, especially in the entorhinal cortex, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the amygdala, the basal forebrain, and the raphe nuclei. They are insoluble and resistant to clearance remaining visible in tissue sections as \"ghost\" or \"tombstone\" tangles long after the death of the parent neuron.Ultrastructurally, they are composed of paired helical filaments along with some straight filaments.A major component of paired helical filaments is abnormally hyperphosphorylated forms of the protein tau. an axonal microtubule-associated protein that enhances microtubule assembly.Other components include MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein-2) and ubiquitin.Paired helical filaments are also found in the dystrophic neurites that form the outer portions of neuritic plaques and in axons coursing through the affected gray matter as neuropil threads.Other FeaturesCerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).Granulovacuolar degeneration: Small (~5 mm in diameter), clear intraneuronal cytoplasmic vacuoles, each of which contains an argyrophilic granule.Hirano bodies are elongated, glassy, eosinophilic bodies consisting of paracrystalline arrays of beaded filaments, with actin as their major component, found most commonly within hippocampal pyramidal cells.Pathologic changes are evident earliest in the entorhinal cortex, then spread through the hippocampal formation and isocortex, and then extend into the neocortex.NIA-Reagan criteria used in the diagnosis.Remember:Amyloid plaques - Extracellular IJ amyloid.Neurofibrillary tangles - Intracellular tau proteins.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA child can make a 3 cube tower at the age of :\n* 36 months (Correct Answer)\n* 15 months\n* 20 months\n* 24 months\n\nExplanation: 15 months\nMotor: Walks alone; crawls upstairs.\nAdaptive:Makes tower of 3 cubes; makes a line with crayon; inserts raisin in bottle.\nLanguage; Jargon; follows simple commands; may name a familiar object (e.g. ball).\nSocial: Indicates some desires or needs by pointing; hugs parents.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA patient who was initially smear positive, who began the treatment and who remained or became smear positive again at five months or later during the course of treatment is called as:\n* Defaulter (Correct Answer)\n* Failure case\n* Relapse\n* None of the above\n\nExplanation: Failure case: A patient who was initially smear positive, who began\nRx and who remained or became smear positive again at five months or later during the course of Rx.\nRelapse: A patient who returns sputum smear positive having previously been treated for tuberculosis and declared cured after the completion of his treatment.\nReturn after default: A patient who returns sputum smear positive, after having left Rx for at least two months.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nThe Earliest sign of male puberty is :\n* Pubic hair\n* Axillary hair\n* Hoarseness of voice (Correct Answer)\n* Testicular enlargement\n\nExplanation: In boys, first visible sign of puberty and hallmark of SMR2 is testicular enlargement, beginning as early as 9½ years. This is followed by penile growth during SMR3. Peak growth occurs when testis volumes reach approximately 9-10 cm3 during SMR4. Under the influence of LH and testosterone, and prostate enlarge. The left testis normally is lower than the right. Some degree of breast hypertrophy, typically bilateral, occurs in 40-65% of boys during SMR2-3 due to a relative excess of estrogenic stimulation\nIn girls, the first visible sign of puberty and the hallmark of SMR2 is the appearance of breast buds, between 8 and 12 years of age. Menses typically begins 2-2½ years later, during SMR3-4 (median age, 12 years; normal range, 9-16 years), around the peak height velocity. Less obvious changes include enlargement of the ovaries, uterus, labia, and clitoris, and thickening of the endometrium and vaginal mucosa\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nSickness benefit under ESI is available for a maximum period of ________ days in a year-\n* 30 days\n* 46 days\n* 56 days (Correct Answer)\n* 91 days\n\nExplanation: Ans- (D) 91 days.

Extended Sickness Benefit(ESB) : SB extendable upto two years in the case of 34 malignant and long-term diseases at an enhanced rate of 80 per cent of wages. Enhanced Sickness Benefit : Enhanced Sickness Benefit equal to full wage is payable to insured persons undergoing sterilization for 7 days/14 days for male and female workers respectively. (c) Maternity Benefit (MB) : Maternity Benefit for confinement/pregnancy is payable for three months, which is extendable by further one month on medical advice at the rate of full wage subject to contribution for 70 days in the preceding year. (d) Disablement Benefit Temporary disablement benefit (TDB) : From day one of entering insurable employment & irrespective of having paid any contribution in case of employment injury. Temporary Disablement Benefit at the rate of 90% of wage is payable so long as disability continues. Permanent disablement benefit (PDB) : The benefit is paid at the rate of 90% of wage in the form of monthly payment depending upon the extent of loss of earning capacity as certified by a Medical Board (e) Dependants' Benefit(DB) : DB paid at the rate of 90% of wage in the form of monthly payment to the dependants of a deceased Insured person in cases where death occurs due to employment injury or occupational hazards. (f) Other Benefits : Funeral Expenses : An amount of Rs.10,000/- is payable to the dependents or to the person who performs last rites from day one of entering insurable employment. Confinement Expenses : An Insured Women or an I.P.in respect of his wife in case confinement occurs at a place where necessary medical facilities under ESI Scheme are not available. In addition, the scheme also provides some other need based benefits to insured workers. Vocational Rehabilitation :To permanently disabled Insured Person for undergoing VR Training at VRS. Physical Rehabilitation : In case of physical disablement due to employment injury. Old Age Medical Care :For Insured Person retiring on attaining the age of superannuation or under VRS/ERS and person having to leave service due to permanent disability insured person & spouse on payment of Rs. 120/- per annum. Rajiv Gandhi Shramik Kalyan Yojana : This scheme of Unemployment allowance was introduced w.e.f. 01-04-2005. An Insured Person who become unemployed after being insured three or more years, due to closure of factory/establishment, retrenchment or permanent invalidity are entitled to :- Unemployment Allowance equal to 50% of wage for a maximum period of upto one year. Medical care for self and family from ESI Hospitals/Dispensaries during the period IP receives unemployment allowance. Vocational Training provided for upgrading skills - Expenditure on fee/travelling allowance borne by ESIC. Incentive to employers in the Private Sector for providing regular employment to the persons with disability : Minimum wage limit for Physically Disabled Persons for availing ESIC Benefits is 25,000/-. Employerss' contribution is paid by the Central Government for 3 years. Benefits & Contributory Conditions : An interesting feature of the ESI Scheme is that the contributions are related to the paying capacity as a fixed percentage of the workers wages, whereas, they are provided social security benefits according to individual needs without distinction. Cash Benefits are disbursed by the Corporation through its Branch Offices (BOs) / Pay Offices (POs), subject to certain contributory conditions.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nOn MRI the differential diagnosis of spinal cord edema is:\n* Mylodysplasia (Correct Answer)\n* Myelomalacia\n* Myelochisis\n* Cord tumors\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nThe rise in the incidence of ectopic pregnancy is related to all, except:\n* Increase in STD\n* ART techniques (Correct Answer)\n* Combine oral contraceptive pills\n* Tubal reconstructive surgery\n\nExplanation: Today rate of ectopic pregnancies has increased dramatically partly due to a rise in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and partly due to a number of other issues. Previous pelvic surgery, congenital or acquired abnormalities of the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes may contribute to the condition, as does tubal\nmicrosurgery, drug ovulation stimulation, and ART.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA 3 week old boy is brought to pediatrics emergency depament with projectile vomiting which is non bilious.

Soon after birth, the baby developed respiratory distress. The diagnosis is -\n* Transient tachypnea of the new bom (Correct Answer)\n* Congenital diaphragmatic hernia\n* Tracheo oesophageal fistula\n* Hyaline membrane disease\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' Transient tachypnea of the newborn (Ref. Nelson, 16th/e, p. 505; Ghai O.P., 5th/e, p. 145).lam going against the majority in this question. Most of the students believe that the answer is a Hyaline membrane.Now read carefully what Nelson has to say about HMD.\" Hyaline membrane disease occurs primarily in premature infants, the incidence is inversely proportional to the gestational age and birth weight. It occurs in 60-80% of infants less than 28 wks of gestational age, in 15-30% of those between 32 and 36 wks in about 5% beyond 37 wk and rarely at term*\".So it must be clear to you that hyaline membrane disease is rare in a term infant and the infant in question is a term infant (40 wks).About transient tachy apnea, It's written that \"it usually follows uneventful normal preterm or term vaginal delivery or Cesarian delivery. \"SOHyaline membrane disease is an important cause of respiratory distress in preterm infants and rarely in term infants whereas transient tachy apnea of the newborn causes respiratory distress in term infants.Now the only confusion left us about diabetes (it increases the incidence of hyaline membrane disease in infants.1 thinks the history of diabetes is given to confuse us.Remember that prematurity is the most important factor for HMD.Well, It's just my way of interpretation of the facts, I may be wrong on this one.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA 50-year-old male patient presented to the OPD with the complaint of progressive dysphagia for 4 months both to solids and liquids but more to the solids.

Unlike combined oral contraceptives, they do not reliably inhibit ovulation. Rather, their effectiveness depends more on alterations in cervical mucus and effects on the endometrium.Because the mucus changes do not last longer than 24 hours, mini-pills should be taken at the same time every day to be maximally effective.These contraceptives have not achieved widespread popularity because of a much higher incidence of irregular bleeding and a somewhat higher pregnancy rate than combined contraceptivesBenefitsProgestin-only pills have minimal if any effect on carbohydrate metabolism or coagulation, and they do not cause or exacerbate hypertension.They may be ideal for some women who are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications. This includes women with a history of thrombosis, hypertension, or migraine headaches, or who are older than 35 years of age and who smoke.The mini-pills is often an excellent choice for lactating women. In combination with breastfeeding, it is virtually 100 percent effective for up to 6 months and does not impair milk productionDisadvantagesThe major drawback of progestin-only pills is a contraceptive failure. With these failures, there is a relative increase in the proportion of ectopic pregnancies.Irregular uterine bleeding is most common and another distinct disadvantage and may manifest as amenorrhea, spotting, breakthrough bleeding, or prolonged periods of amenorrhea or menorrhagia.Functional ovarian cysts develop with a greater frequency in women using these agents, although they do not usually necessitate intervention.A distinct disadvantage is that these contraceptives must be taken at the same or nearly the same time dailyFinally, unlike combined oral contraceptives, the mini-pills does not improve acne and may even worsen it in some women. Contraindications:Progestin-only pills are contraindicated in women with unexplained uterine bleeding, especially in older women.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nWhich one of these should not to be used in severe widespread psoriasis?\n* Methotrexate\n* Oral retinoids\n* Cyclosporin (Correct Answer)\n* Oral glucocorticoids\n\nExplanation: Ans-D\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nAn infant presents with lethargy, frontal bossing and bowing of legs.

In Stevens- Johnson syndrome, lesions involve not only the skin but also the lips and oral mucosa, conjunctiva, urethra, and genital and perianal areas. On histologic examination, the \"targetoid\" lesions show a superficial perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate associated with dermal edema and accumulation of lymphocytes. These are along the dermo-epidermal junction, where they are intimately associated with degenerating and necrotic keratinocytes, a pattern termed interface dermatitis. It is a type of type 4 hypersensitivity reaction. Treatment approved are: - Steroids IVIg Cyclosporine Etanercept Image A shows Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction Image B shows Type 2 hypersensitivity reaction Image C shows Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nTuberculous arthritis of a joint in sites other than the spine in advanced cases leads to whcih of the following -\n* Bony ankylosis (Correct Answer)\n* Fibrous ankylosis\n* Loose joints\n* Charcot's joints\n\nExplanation: Ans- B Fibrous ankylosis is usual outcome of healed tuberculosis of joints except in spine where bony ankylosis takes place.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nTrue statement regarding Achondroplasia is :\n* AR inheritance\n* Shortened spine\n* Increased risk of pathological fracture (Correct Answer)\n* Diagnosed at birth by X-ray\n\nExplanation: Ans: D Ref: Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures, 9th edition Explanation: \"Achondroplasia typically manifests at birth with short limbs, a long narrow trunk, and a large head with midfacial hypoplasia and prominent forehead and skeletal radiographs confirm the diagnosis. \"Ref: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics. 19th ed. Achondroplasia Causes 'disproportionate' dwarfism. Most common cause of; short-limb' dwarfism. The trunk is disproportionately long in comparison to the limbs. The proximal segments of limbs are disproportionately short - rhizomelic shortening. Other Features o Large skull with prominent forehead, o Saddle-shaped nose, o Frontal bossing, o Mid-face hypoplasia, o Stubby, splayed fingers {trident hands), o Mental development is normal. o During adulthood, short vertebral pedicles may lead to lumbar spinal stenosis. Incidence: 1 in 30,000 births. Inheritance: Autosomal dominant transmission. 80 per cent of cases are sporadic. Occurs due to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) gene on chromosome 4 causing a diminution in endochondral bone growth. Average adult height is usually around 122 cm (48 inches). Disproportionate shortening of the limb bones is detectable in utero by ultrasound scan. X-Rays All bones that are formed by endochondral ossification are affected Tubular bones are short but thick. Metaphyses is flared. Pelvic cavity is small and the iliac wings are flared, producing an almost horizontal acetabular roof. The vertebral interpedicular distance diminishes from L1 to L5. The spinal canal is reduced in size. Vertebral features are best defined on CT or MRI. Also Note: Spinal shortening is not a prominent feature of achondroplasia. Instead, achondroplasia is characterized by a trunk which is disproportionately long in relation to the limbs. Other Similar Conditions: Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia (MED): Widespread involvement of the epiphyses. Vertebrae are usually spared. Shortening is lesser than in achondroplasia. Face, skull, and spine are normal. Usually, involve only one or two pairs of joints. Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia (SED): Multiple epiphyseal dysplasias along with well-marked vertebral changes. Vertebral changes include, o Delayed ossification. o Flattening of the vertebral bodies (platyspondyly). o Irregular ossification of the ring epiphyses. o Indentations of the end-plates (Schmorl's nodes).\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nAll of the following are major criteria inthe diagnosis of Acute Rheumatic Fever, except -\n* Prolonged PR interval (Correct Answer)\n* Subcutaneous Nodules\n* Chorea\n* Carditis\n\nExplanation: Ans-A Prolonged PR interval\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nAll are true regarding oral hairy leukoplakia except: (Repeat)\n* It is premalignant (Correct Answer)\n* Associated with EBV infection\n* Seen in HIV infected patients\n* Hyperkeratosis on HPE\n\nExplanation: Ans: A (It is premalignant) Ref: Robbin's' Pathology Basis of disease, 8th ed Explanation: Leukoplakia is premalignant. not OHL. ORAL HAIRY LEUKOPLAKIA (OHL) Hairy leukoplakia is a distinctive oral lesion that is usually seen in immunocompromised patients. Approximately S0% of patients with hairy leukoplakia are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 20% of lesions are seen in patients who are immunocompromised for other reasons, such as cancer therapy or transplant immune-suppression. Hairy leukoplakia takes the form of white, confluent patches of fluffy (\"hairy\"), hyperkeratotic thickenings, almost always situated on the lateral border of the tongue. Unlike thrush, the lesion cannot be scraped off. The distinctive microscopic appearance consists of hyperparakeratosis and acanthosis with \"balloon cells\" in the upper spinous layer. There is no dysplasia (It is not premalignant). Sometimes there is koilocytosis of the superficial, nucleated epidermal cells, suggesting human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and HPY transcripts have occasionally been found within the cells. However, EBV is present in most cells and is now accepted as the cause of the condition. Sometimes there is superimposed candidal infection on the surface of the lesions, adding to the \"hairiness.\" In HIV-positive individuals, with hairy leukoplakia, symptoms of AIDS follow in 2 to 3 years.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nWhich of the following conditions promotes adipocere formation:\n* Dry and hot (Correct Answer)\n* Hot and humid\n* Dry and optimum\n* Cold and moist\n\nExplanation: Ans. b. Hot and humid (Ref: Redcfy 33 fepl71, 29/epl54; Parikh 6/e p3.30)ideal conditions for adipocere formation are hot temperature, humid and diminution of air.\"Ideal conditions for adipocere formation are warm (hot) temperature, moisture (humid) and diminution of airQ e.g. dead body immersed in water or damp soil.\"Adipocere (Saponification)* It is due to conversion of unsaturated liquid fats (oieic acid) to saturated solid fats (hydroxystearic and oxostearic acid) under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by CL perfringens.* It is modification of putrefaction in which there is conversion of unsaturated liquid fats (oleic acid) to saturated solid fats under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by Clostridium perfringens.* The change is due to gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of preexisting fats^ into higher fatty acids which combines with calcium and ammonium ions to form in soluble soaps which being acidic inhibit putrefaction bacteria.* Ultimately palmitic, oieic, stearic and hydroxystearic acid are formed, mixture of these is known as adipocere.* Adipocere has a distinct offensive or sweetish smelt5 but during early stages ammonical odour is noticedIdeal Conditions for Adipocere* Warm temperature* Moisture3* Relative diminution of air* First seen in subcutaneous fatty deposits of cheeks, breast, buttocks and abdomen.* Shortest recorded period (in India) is 3 days 22 hours* Shortest time for adipocere formation in summer is 3 weeks. Time for whole body to be converted into adipocere = 12 months\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA 35-year-old woman presented with swelling and pain of her left wrist of ten days' duration. Twelve days ago she was bitten on the left hand by her pet cat. Two days later she developed pain, redness, and swelling of her hand. O/E, Mild fever Erythematous left wrist and thenar eminence Reduced range of motion of fingers The white blood cell count was 13,000/ml, with a marked increase in the percentage of immature granulocytes. Gram stain of the wrist fluid was done. What is the most likely cause?\n* Pasteurella multocida (Correct Answer)\n* Baonella henselae\n* Streptobacillus moniliformis\n* Lactobacillus casei\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A (Pasteurella multocida), a gram-negative rod that frequents the mouths of some animals, paicularly cats, but also dogs. The extreme sharpness of feline teeth causes enormous pressure at the site of the puncture during a bite, allowing inoculation of the organism deep into tissues. B (Baonella henselae) is incorrect, although it is a gram-negative rod associated with exposure to cats. In immunocompetent hosts, the principal condition caused by this organism, which is carried mainly on the paws of cats, is cat scratch disease, whose name implies transmission by cat scratches not cat bites. C (Streptobacillus moniliformis) is also a gram-negative rod, pleomorphic, which is most commonly acquired by the bite or scratch of rats or mice. Although it may be carried--and transmitted--by carnivores that prey on these rodents, it is less characteristically associated with cat induced injuries than with rat or mouse exposure. The simplest reason that D (Lactobacillus casei) cannot be a correct answer because it is a gram-positive rod, not a gram-negative one.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nDevelopment of diaphragmbegins at 4 weeks of gestation. Diaphragm has contributions from different structures. Central tendon of diaphragm develops from?\n* Dorsal mesooesophagus (Correct Answer)\n* Septum transversum\n* Pleuro peritoneal membrane\n* Cervical myotomes\n\nExplanation: Development of Diaphragm\nDiaphragm develops from\nSeptum transversum: it is a mass of mesodermal tissue arising from coelomic wall at the 4rd week of gestation. It forms the central tendon of diaphragm.\nDorsal mesooesophagus forms the median portion of diaphragm & the crurae.\nCervical myotomes (from C3-C5 somites) of lateral body wall form the peripheral parts of diaphragm.\nPleuro-peritoneal membranes.\nChromosome 15q plays a major role in diaphragm development\n- During the initial period of development, it lies at a higher level (cervical) and then migrates caudally and hence the nerve supply is from C3, C4, C5 (Phrenic nerve).\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nCorneal curvature measured by -\n* Keratometry (Correct Answer)\n* Pachymetry\n* Gonioscopy\n* Perimetry\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Keratometry o The 'Keratometry' or 'ophthalmometry' is an objective method of estimating the corneal astigmatism by measuring the curvature of central cornea.o Gonioscopy - Biomicroscopic examination of the angle of anterior chamber,o Perimetry - Procedure of estimating the extent of visual fields.o Tonography - Non - invasive technique for determining the facility of aqeous outflow (C - value).\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA 50-year-old man complains of swelling of the neck and shoness of breath for 7 days. He has noticed some nasal stuffiness with hoarseness of his voice for about 4 weeks and had attributed these symptoms to an upper respiratory infection. He denies the use of alcohol but has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years. Lately, he feels as though something is pushing against his throat. On physical examination, the patient's face appears ruddy and swollen. The jugular veins are distended. Following sign is observed in the patient. Chest x ray was done with the following findings. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n* Retrosternal goiter\n* Thymoma (Correct Answer)\n* SVC syndrome\n* Congestive cardiac failure\n\nExplanation: 1st image shows the classical Pembeon sign. 2nd image shows a mass in the right mediastinum-s/o CA lung causing compression of SVC. The SVC receives venous drainage from the head, neck, upper limb, and thorax. Located in the upper mediastinum, this thin-walled vessel is susceptible to pressure from external sources. The most common cause of such external compression is malignancy, usually from a right-side bronchogenic carcinoma. Presents with dyspnea, hoarseness and Horner syndrome. The development of SVC syndrome is often an emergency because the trachea may be obstructed, leading to respiratory compromise.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nExample of electrical synapse:\n* Tight junction (Correct Answer)\n* Gap junctions\n* Anchoring junction\n* Neuromuscular junction\n\nExplanation: (Refer: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 24th edition, pg no: 43-44)\nIntercellular junctions\n\nConnects the cell membranes of the neighboring cells also known as junctional complexes\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nWhich one of the following clinical signs is not seen in ophthalmic Graves’disease?\n* Lid retraction (Correct Answer)\n* Frequent blinking\n* Poor convergence\n* Upper lid “lag” on down gaze\n\nExplanation: Manifestations of Graves’ disease:\n1.Diffuse hyperfunctioning goiter—bruit over gland.\n2. Graves’ ophthalmopathy—inflammatory infiltrate of orbital contents, exclusive of globe, with lymphocytes, mast\ncells, and plasma cells.\nIt has two components—\n(a) spastic—stare, lid lag, lid retraction,\n(b) mechanical—proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, congestiveoculopathy (chemosis, conjunctivitis, periorbital swelling), corneal ulceration, optic neuritis, optic atrophy.\nDermatopathy—thickening of dermis, which is infiltrated with lymphocytes and with hydrophilic, metachromatically staining mucopolysaccharides.

It is useful because it involves 4 simple questions, of which only 2 need to be answered positively for the individual to be indicated as possibly alcohol dependent. Do you ever feel like you should Cut down your drinking? (C) Do you ever feel Angry/Annoyed when people try to talk to you about drinking? (A) Do you ever feel Guilty as a consequence of drinking? (G) Do you ever need an Eye opener-a drink of alcohol in the morning - before you can function? (E) o The SAD-Q (severity of alcohol-dependent questionnaire) is more specific 20 questionnaires designed to measure the severity of alcohol dependence. There are five subscales with four items in each: Physical withdrawal, effective withdrawal, withdrawal relief drinking, alcohol consumption and rapidity of reinstatement Each item is scored on a 4 point scale, ranging from 'almost never ' to 'Nearly always resulting in a corresponding score to 3. Thus the total maximum score possible is 60 and the minimum is 0.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nShingles caused by infection with:\n* Varicella zoster virus (Correct Answer)\n* Herpes simplex virus\n* Human papilloma virus\n* Epstein-Barr virus\n\nExplanation: Ref.

DISEASE EB SIMPLEX (MOST COMMON) DYSTROPHIC EB JUNCTIONAL EB BLISTERS IN EPIDERMIS IN DERMIS B/W DERMIS AND EPIDERMIS MUTATIONS K 5 OR K 14 COL7A1 LAMA3, LAMB3\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA 55-year-old known smoker for 25 years presents with a low pitched voice. Endoscopy shows a mass limited to the vocal cord on the left. A biopsy is suggestive of laryngeal cancer type T1N0. Treatment of choice would be -\n* Vertical partial hemilaryngectomy (Correct Answer)\n* Radiotherapy\n* Chemotherapy\n* Total laryngectomy with cervical lymph node dis section\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., Radiotherapy Treatment of glottic cancero Stage-dependent treatment include:-i) Carcinoma in situ (CIN):- Best treated by transoral endoscopic CO2 laser. If the laser is not available stripping of vocal cord is done and the tissue is sent for biopsy. If the biopsy shows invasive carcinoma, radiotherapy is given otherwise regular follow up is done?ii) T1 carcinoma:- Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice. Surgery is used only after they recur.# T1 carcinoma with extension to anterior commissure:- The treatment of choice is radiotherapy. If it is unavailable, frontolateral partial laryngectomy is done with regular follow up. If it fails, total laryngectomy is performed.# T1 Ca with extension to arytenoid:- Treatment is same as above but surgery is preferrediii) T2 carcinoma:- Treatment depends on- i) Mobility of vocal cords, and ii) Involvement of anterior commissure and/or arytenoid:a) If the mobility of the cord is not impaired (cord is mobile) and anterior commissure and/or arytenoid not involved.# Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice. In case of recurrence total laryngectomy or partial vertical laryngectomy is doneb) If the mobility of cord is impaired or anterior commissure and/or arytenoid involved:- Voice preserving conservative surgery such as vertical hemilaryngectomy or frontolateral laryngectomy is done. Total laryngectomy is done if there is recurrence on follow up.iv) T3 and T4 carcinoma:- Total laryngectomy is the treatment of choice; combined with neck dissection if the nodes are palpable. More advanced lesions are treated by combined therapy, i.e., surgery with postoperative radiotherapy.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia shows which clinical features-\n* Female pseudo hermaphrodite (pseudohermaph rodstism)\n* Hypertension\n* Electrolyte imbalance (Correct Answer)\n* All of above\n\nExplanation: Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of above Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) o Group of AR disorder o MC adrenal disorder in childhood 0 Most common =21 -hydroxylase deficiency OTHER IMP POINTS:-- 1-MALE PSEUDOOHERMAPHRODITISM IS SEEN IN- 17 alpha OH deficency 3 beta OH deficiency 2-HTN(hypernatremia and hypokalemia) is seen in- 17 alpha OH deficiency 11 beta OH deficiency\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nA 42- year old man is undergoing chemotherapy after resection of a cecal adenocarcinoma with positive lymph nodes. Which of the following potentially operable complications is a common occurrence among patients receiving systemic chemotherapy?\n* Acute cholecystitis (Correct Answer)\n* Perirectal abscess\n* Appendicitis\n* Diverticulitis\n\nExplanation: A surgeon is frequently asked to evaluate patients who are receiving systemic chemotherapy Most complications of chemotherapy do not require surgical therapy. Perirectal abscesses are more common in these immunosuppressed patients. 'Gastrointestinal bleeding occurs secondary to mucosal irritation and thrombocytopenia, Pancreatitis is uncommon, but is associated with L-asparaginase use. Up to 20% of patients treated with floxuridine by continuous hepatic artery infusion develop some degree of inflammation and obstruction of the bile duct. Systemic chemotherapy does not increase the likelihood of acute cholecystitis. appendicitis, incarcerated femoral hernia, or diverticulitis.\n\n## Question from Unknown:\nTrue about \"Michaelis-Guttman\" bodies?\n* Calcium deposition in lysosomes\n* Located in inter-cellular spaces\n* May involve lungs and colon apart from urinary tract (Correct Answer)\n* All of the above\n\nExplanation: Ans. d (All of the above) (Ref.
